Techmemos	<14283177.1075857036653.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	gas prices	Vince-  1. We can detect hoarding of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow.  2. We can detect market power by dissociating the seller from the buyer,  distinguishing between the physical cost in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.  3. (As you noted) We can detect storage as the difference between inflow  and consumption.  It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market  prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors:  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.  We can calibrate the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.  What the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage  and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and  each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.  Finally,  flows are explained by the model, and can be imputed from prices if  necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather.  I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a  model.

Techmemos	<22467562.1075857036607.JavaMail.evans@thyme>		Vince and Vasant:  Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at  the East Desk, related to gas transmission:  Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example  might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay  $12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed  payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs (shrinkage) and 6.5% for  overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a  delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 (basis), and might call Brooklyn  and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The traders spread is  $0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would  offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.   As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have  an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.  Also, many pipelines dont discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum  (its not worth their time to haggle) (There is a further issue of  secondary markets not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and  Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take  (pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the  system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,  in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

A higher bid was submitted prior to  Wednesdays 1 p.m. MST      deadline in a four-day open season, a pipeline spokesman said. However,  the original      negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and  retain the capacity.        The new bid was for $38 million over one year starting Jan. 1, about $8  million more than      the amount in Fridays announcement ($30 million). One source called it  ridiculous that      someone was willing to pay so much for the space, given that on a  mark-to-market basis      the capacity is worth only about $20-25 million.        Late last week some sources speculated that Duke Energy was the  recipient of next      years package given its large power generation holdings in California.  A marketer      yesterday said he believed Dynegy upped the ante. Rather than go  through all the      hassles they [Dynegy] had at FERC with the 1998-99 package, they let  someone else do      all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid. That way  no one can      complain that the procedure was tainted. After all, Dynegy has quite a  few power plants      in California to keep fueled, and all of their current FT on El Paso  expires at the end of      this year. Of course, they still could be thwarted if the original  negotiated customer      matches their bid. It may all sound kind of Machiavellian but sort of  makes sense. Other      sources heavily discounted the chances of Dynegy being the new high  bidder, pointing out      that the company made significantly less than expected this year because  San      Juan/border basis differentials narrowed significantly. A Dynegy source  indicated that the      company was involved in the bidding and lost to Duke in the first round.        Regardless of what happens next year, a marketer noted that the Southern  California      border/San Juan basis spread continues to compress as SoCal Gas  withdraws from      storage and east-of-California utilities exercise their peaking  contracts because of cold      weather in the Rockies and elsewhere in the West. From a December index  spread of 29      cents, the border/basin gap was down to about 18 cents Wednesday, she  said.

Techmemos	<8722551.1075857036540.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: working gas price model	Vince-  I have a simplified version of Brads model in mind.  The no arbitrage condition equates trading margins across the country.  Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is  almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost  completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call  option.  The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing  gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas  from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are  the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for  transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and  the valuations of the storage option.  There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork.  They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short  time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability  mentioned above, or point-estimates (calibrations) using only todays data  based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with  the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price  versus capacity similarly, competing for outflows.  I will write this up for you in Scientific Word and present it to you at your  earliest convenience.

Dear Vince Kaminski  Thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting.  I have been always inspired by and having respect for the recent revolutionary achievements of Enron in the energy markets My former employer McKinsey Tokyo in fact featured your company*s success in the last Quarterly, and it clearly states (in Japanese though) that the quantitative research capability at Enron is now at the world*s top level, which has been always behind the scene.  I am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field; However, very unfortunately I will have to come back to Japan, or at least to the East Asian region,  upon graduation due to an inevitable family reason. My wife*s father passed away recently and an old mother-in-law is now left alone without relatives. I understand that Enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing the outdated Japanese energy market, (which by the way I strongly hope ) so I may not have a very good chance of making contribution at your company right now.  Lastly, if you need a staff in Tokyo in some future who understands  both the risk management analytics at the F622 level and the local language and business custome better than average, please contact me any time.

London	<362185.1075857051284.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	New Volatility Curve Generator for UK Power	We have established a set of power volatility curves down to the EFA/monthly  level of detail that can be marked to market up to 6 years out.  Beyond this,  the volatility decays to what we understand to be the long-term level for  power volatility, given our understanding of the behaviour of forward prices  over large time-scales.  The swaption traders can now fit the first 5-6 years of the volatility curve  to the market-observed baseload swaption implied volatilities (typically 3 to  12 months duration for the underlying swap) and then be in a good position to  price other swaptions (including swaptions on individual EFA slots)  consistent with the curve.  There may also be an impact on the daily VaR  calculation.  An illustration of the current volatility curves is pasted below:-     These curves will be reset as the market moves, and allow a mark-to-market  approach to be followed for our volatility book.

Techmemos	<24634786.1075857036518.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	GPCM Summary 1999	This has been a great year for RBAC and GPCM. During the year we have doubled to 10 the number of GPCM licensees. This means weve also doubled the number of wonderful people weve trained and are supporting. And, I sincerely mean it when I say it has been a real pleasure working with you all. One of the things we stress when we are selling GPCM is that it takes a strong commitment on the part of the licensee, a commitment to find skilled and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool.  And, Im happy to report that we have that quality in the GPCM teams we work with. Next year we have some big challenges.  We will be converting the system from Office 97 to Office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run in the Windows 2000 environment. We will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price curves to enable users, especially pipeline users, to test variations of pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization. We will be adding a capability for modeling future FT contracting. We will upgrade our existing Database Comparison program to allow you to select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own databases. We will continue to work with RDI to improve pipeline and storage infrastructure representations, to provide interfaces between GASdat and GPCM, and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases. We are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to GPCM licensees (and possibly prospects).  We have acquired gpcm.rbac.com and gpcm.net for this purpose. In making these various changes, we look also to you, our existing licensees, for enhancement and improvement ideas.  We are planning to conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find out what you like, but also what you would like to see improved, as well as some new ideas for GPCM.  I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to GPCM during 1999.  o Liam Leahy for his excellent marketing, sales, and planning support o Charles Carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle Visual Basic programming issues o Richard Berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled Windows programming o Richard McBride for continuing support and development of his EMNET optimization program o Aaron and James Brooks for design and production of the PowerPoint pipeline maps now available in GPCM o Mike Farina and RDI for their continuing improvement of the GPCM data and GASdat database o GPCM users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we could get them corrected o GPCM users who have suggested new features which would make GPCM a better product o GPCM users who have given us sales leads during the year o GPCM users who have used GPCM to help their companies make better plans and decisions, which is, after all, the purpose for which it was designed  We hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an even better year 2000.

The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below  should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.  I am currently in  Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.  I maybe needing a surgery for the  slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery wont be needed.  I would like to wis you all a very happy XMas and a Great New Year, and will  catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.  I can  see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get  some help from your end.

Vivek & I have also worked out a methodology for computing tariff for this  firm power sale during the peak period. In doing this, we have tried to keep  the tariff formula as simple as possible, while simulating the PPA tariffs to  the extent possible. (Currently, we have just shown the tariff computation;  will put the tariff formula in the next mail)  The tariff structure & the issue list obviously need further refinement,  before we discuss it with MSEB.

Apart  from clarifying the timeliness, or lack thereof, of the published  state-specific wellhead production estimates, he indicates their scientists  find severe weather in the fields (freezes, hurricanes) to be a far more  significant issue in production, and in wellhead prices, than is severe  weather in the Northeast, for instance. Also, he agrees with you as to there  being strictly increasing marginal costs in production, there being a rich  texture of wells in terms of their efficiency, technologies, maintenance and  investment issues.

Techmemos	<14574687.1075857036474.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: natural gas storage item	Vince-  Something very interesting about natural gas storage (from the class).  The industry is rapidly adopting what are called Operational Balancing  Agreements, where the pipeline contracts with the producers and LDCs  (public utilities) to handle all imbalances in shipping, namely all  production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise.  Shippers then  always book what is scheduled to happen, and not what actually happens.   The end result is that storage facillities associated with production regions  are used to smooth out not only weekday-weekend seasonal patterns (the  well-known parking) but to insure issues of wellhead output as well.  Cutting to the chase, storage facilities in producing regions are operated to  insure the integrity of the pipeline system, and estimated marketed  production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipelines  receipt meter than is production less local storage.

And if not - can you tell me if it was published by Risk UK or Risk in the  States? And which issue was it? I just want to have all of the details if I  need to call someone at the magazine ...

Techmemos	<25693256.1075857036452.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	New basis report	Bhavna:  The basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices. It is called  Basisnw7.xls and is in the ERG database. It looks to be working correctly, but of course without data it is a little  hard to confirm.  As always, it is ultimately your job to verify that the  numbers reported are correct.  Lemme know if there are problems.    It is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year.  You should keep  this mail message as a reference. 1)  Add 12 to the expression in PrintMacro!B35 i.e. change  COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+63,i,12,1)) to  COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+75,i,12,1))  2) Define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be  printed out on the report page.  For example, last year, the basis report  went from Jan 93 to Dec 1999. In Basisnw6.xls there is a name Jan93 defined  as Basis!A64 (i.e. refers to the row where the Jan 1993 basis numbers are  recorded).  This year, in Basisnw7.xls, I defined  Jan94 to refer to  Basis!A76.  Thats because the basis report will now run from Jan 1994 to  Dec 2000.  3)  Change the expression in PrintMacro!B45 to use this new cell reference  i.e.  change COPY(OFFSET(Jan93,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)) to  COPY(OFFSET(Jan94,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1))  4) Having executed steps 1) - 3) the spreadsheet will now print numbers  shifted up by one year.  All that remains to do is to change the dates on the  PrintFormat page to be one year more.  By that I mean change 1998 to 1999,  1999 to 2000, change 98/99 to 99/00, etc.  Dont move any numbers or formulas!   Thats it.  As we discussed Bhavna, while I am happy to do this for you, it  is not in your or my best interest for this to continue.  Please do work to  find some one in your shop to maintain this spreadsheet.   Regards, and Happy New Year! Grant.

Index VaR and the Vega VaR status: Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new  version by IT,  the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting  list to get into  IT groups door.  Currently, they are struggling with the  Credit Model.  Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the Prudency  model after the Credit and before anything else.  So, its uncertain when  they can begin these two projects.  Credit Reserve Model status: New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage.  Two major  difference exist between the new and old versions: 1)  Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full  evaluation.  IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the  Spread option and Swaption evaluation.  I am working with them on it. 2) Insurance projects are new to the new version.  IT also wants our help too.  Only after the IT finishes the debugging process, could we start testing the  new version with the current one.  Thanks.

If the average price of the prompt month crude oil in a specified time window  falls below the strike price, the option pays a lump sum of money secified by the digital payout in the model.     As a comparison, I also included European option on the Asian Strip.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Weve finally got our computers hooked up, so we are off and  running now.  Actually, we got quite of few projects going on up here (yes,  these are real projects) and we are going to need the Houston Structuring  group for support.  I dont know if you guys are still short-handed and what  kind of projects you may already have lined-up, but I wanted list out some of  the projects that we are currently working on.  GAS  LRG project -  Deirde is currently working on this with Russell  NSS storage - Sean Boyle helped value both their current and new NSS.  We are  currently working on negotiating with Peoples for these, and I expect that  there may be additional requests in the future.  Manlove Summer Withdraw program - Yes this is not a typo.  Surprise,  Surprise... Manlove can do a lot more than we thought.  Ive talked to  Deirdre about it and created a simple model, but I would like to better  analyze this with your help.  Capital Improvements - Weve got Peoples Christmas list of capital projects  that we are going to help them analyze and seek if any of these make sense.  Sendout model - We would like to help them better optimize their morning  sendout taking into account current market pricing and the Enron supply deal.  PBR - We are not sure when or if  Peoples will file a PBR, but I think that  there are a lot of things that we learned during our previous experience that  we can do to help them prepare for a competitive marketplace (ie transport  customers tariff restructuring)  PESC - Peoples is looking for assistance in understanding load following and  helping them build models to optimize their retail gas effort  San Juan pricing - Evan has been working with the Desk to provide indicative  pricing with regard to PEC hedging out some of their San Juan production  reserves  Power  Power project development - we have several power projects underway and the  CTG group (Billy Lemmons) is helping us create necessary models   PESC - the retail power stuff lives.  Ive think that Fallon has a new  attitude on these deals and Enron has committed to help them figure out this  market.  Power plant balancing model - we have in our portfolio and will be offering  balancing/storage services for Chicago area power projects.  We would like to  have a model or at least a better understanding to help us with this endeavor.   We have resources in Chicago dedicated to these projects, as well as the  other stuff were trying to do like negotiate contracts and set up the  Chicago back office function.  We plan on adding our own structuring  resources (in Chicago or Houston), but we felt that we ought to start by  figuring out what support the Houston office will be able to provide.  I will  be in the office this Monday (Jan 17), so I hope to be able to catch up with  you and discuss some of these items then.

Techmemos	<15770238.1075857036386.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	a basic idea of price-offer matching clauses	Vince-  Here is the basic idea I was alluding to:  Suppose a car dealer promised to match any advertised price. Then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind. And so on, until all  dealers advertised they would match any advertised price. Now, consider one  of these dealers decision to perhaps lower his prices. If he does so,  everyone will immediately match his price, so his market share will remain  unchanged, at whatever it was before, but his revenues (and all other dealers  as well) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction. So, the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars.  Now, suppose a limited partnership, where the partners contract to control  who they are in business with, by putting a right of first refusal clause  into the partnerships papers, whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares. Now, suppose you are an  outsider, considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership. You know if your offer is a good one from your  perspective, offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return, the  existing partners will match it, and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid, from your own pocket, for your due diligence. Conversely, if  you offer too much for the shares, then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid. In neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners. So, you (basically) dont make an offer.  So, a partners shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them. The right of first refusal clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares  (essentially) illiquid.

We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with  a numerical estimate of the value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has  distributional consequences: he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of  the value of this option could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific;  so we shall rather  produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.  Vince Kaminski   ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 01/20/2000  08:34 AM ---------------------------   Clayton Vernon@ENRON 01/20/2000 08:29 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, zlu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: auctions with an incumbents right of first refusal  Vince-  Here is an essay on the issue you are discussing:   The Adverse Economic Impact of Rights of First Refusal  An option to first refuse to match a competitors offer is a restraint of  free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace. This economic  conclusion is unambiguous.  If an incumbent has the right to match an offer made by a competitor, for  an item or service of value, then few competitors will invest the time and  expense necessary to prepare and submit offers, those offers will be lower  than they would have been otherwise, and the contract will often be awarded  to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger.  In a traditional auction, where all bids are sealed and the item up for  auction is awarded to the highest bidder, we can safely predict the item will  be awarded to the bidder who values it the most, at a price reflecting the  full value of the item up for auction.  This is the efficient result in a  market economy, because the financing of the high bid reflects resources  freely allocated to the high bidder.  If the auction has open bids, we can  again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder, albeit at  a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the  highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the  second-highest valuation.  Now, in a modified auction, where an incumbent bidder has the right to match  the highest bid and retain the item for himself, each competing bidder must  justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the  following, and likely, scenario: the incumbent does not spend himself for due  diligence, but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the  top bid from a competitor.  Simply put, the incumbent with a right of first refusal can be safely  predicted to simply match their competitors bid by rule of thumb. But the  incumbents valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor, by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses.  And, the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors, not only in their valuations themselves, a nontrivial  financial exercise, but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid.  Furthermore, in an esoteric concept known as the Winners Curse, a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails, if the incumbent fails to match  it, he almost certainly overbid.  Given this, most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal, and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time, expense and expertise necessary; they may  just fire off a low-ball bid.  After all, in almost every conceivable  state of the world arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money.  So, the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below-market price, despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use.

Projects	<29224241.1075857033589.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Spreadsheet for George Posey	Vince-  Here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church.  First off, it appears from the data that a special appeal for fund giving  was made (from the pulpit?) on April 19, 1998 and April 25, 1999, (perhaps  tied rhetorically into Income Taxes?). Then, by going back and incorporating  obvious dates from the calendars for 1997-1999, the following regression  analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:  giving this Sunday = $4403  + a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since  Jan. 5, 1997)  + no pure effect from last weeks contributions (i.e., denies first-order  autoregressive effects)  + $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas  + $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,1998 or April 25,1999  - $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday  - $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving  - $73  if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)  The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3  years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for  2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.

Saudis sold Cal 00 naphtha at $8 M/T over the Platts AG mean and the  Kuwaitis are offer their naphtha at $11 M/T over the mean.  ENOC offered 700,000 tons of term naphtha and only sold 200,000 tons. ADNOCs splitters should add even more naphtha supplies to the market. Koch has closed their Rotterdam splitter due to poor economics. Not  necessarily a permanent shutdown. He expects the Brent/Dubai spread to return to more normal $1-$1.25/barrel. Regarding condensate he predicts that actual demand will drive the market and  there will be less bottomfeeding by the Japanese and other refiners. He does  feel         the new splitters will reduce the worldwide volumes available,  but that there will still be adequate supplies.  He thinks crack spreads for refiners will still be weak during Cal 00. Although some resid demand will be displaced by natural gas or LNG, he  expects fairly stable differentials to crude. He expects strong US gasoline demand, but limits his demand growth projection  to 1% for the year.

Techmemos	<29942038.1075857036318.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Template for pricing the right of first refusal	Shelley and Chris,  I have set up a template for pricing ROFRs.  The ROFR is priced as a series  forward start options.  A forward start option gives the holder the right to exercise the option but  the strike price is set at the money in future before the option expiration.  The feature  mimics the matching the best bid in the ROFR.  The underlying for the option is the best bid, which should  be closely related to the price differential between the two hubs that the pipeline connects. Therefore  the ROFR is case dependent, as Vince pointed out.  The volatility can be estimated from the best bid  price history.   With these inputs we can estimate the value of ROFR.

Australia	<9045002.1075857010494.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Energy Derivatives Book	Hi Vince,  It was good to speak to you and Grant the other day.  Plese find attached a block of 3 chapters that are basically the middle of the book. This should give you an idea at the level it is pitched - although these are probably some of the the most technical of the chapters. Julie who works for us will be getting in contact with you soon to chase you up on your chapter!  Ive asked Julie to have a chat to you about a couple of other things at the same time. I hope this is OK with you. Julie and I will be making a trip thru Houston around the third week of February to try and visit some energy companies. Its mainly a fact finding trip to see what the energy companies are doing and how we might be able to make use of our skills in a commercial sense. Would you recommend any people we should talk too? Also we will be running a course on energy derivatives in Houston at the end of March following the success of the course in New York last year and want to advertise this. Do you know of people who would be interested in such a course?  We are currently putting together promotional material for the book - can you please let Julie know how you and Grant would like to be advertised - your official positions, etc.  Best regards, and I look forward to reading your chapter soon.

Techmemos	<11816806.1075857036296.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: convergence of the Research model	I was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of  the number of simulations we use. This question, I think, is not so important  when we  calculate credit reserve, because the assumptions underlying our model are  pretty  rough anyway (here I mean the assumptions regarding price processes,  correlations, etc.)  This question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating  sensitivities of the  credit reserve to various factors. When the magnitude of the sensitivity is  comparable to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve, what is the accuracy of  such sensitivity?    I performed a numerical experiment where I calculated the expected loss for a simple portfolio with one counterparty (SITHE IND POWER) for different number of simulations (10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000) using old research  credit model. You can see how the result converges and the relative error (compared to the  result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate) in  the  attached file.  Tanya.

Promigas, in partnership with others,  wants to acquire $80 MM TVCable  company in Mexico. Promigass ownership would be 25%, i.e. , 20MM.  10MM of it would come from  debt. Enron wants to participate this deal by offer Promigas loan guarantee in  exchange of call options on 50% Promigas equity in TVCable.  Following suggestions have been made:  1) get a market quote for the loan guarantee;     use credit risk model to price the guarantee internally;     need to speak to Vasant  2) find a comparable company, study the volatility     using company value histogram from economics model(crystal ball output),  I can fit a lognormal     distribution, then find the volatility  3)calcalte the call option value, find braek-even strike.

Techmemos	<31476824.1075857036273.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: stressing correlations	Hi, everybody,  following up on our discussions on stressing correlations I made a  spreadsheet and a DLL.  Here is what it does:  in the input (Main sheet) the user has to specify: -the size of the correlation matrix; -the row and column for the element he wants to stress (row=1 and col=3 in  the example) -the integer number N_iter; -the original correlation matrix.  In the output (see sheet Results) we see 2 columns: -the first column contains possible correlation values (from -1 to 1,  N_iter+1 numbers) for the element (1,3),  -the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the stressed  correlation matrix  (which is the same as the original matrix except the elements (1,3) and (3,1)  which take values from -1 to 1).  Thus, the user can see which values for the chosen element (1,3) are  permitted  (those for which the smallest  eigenvalue is positive (marked green in the  example).  The user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is not  permitted to this particular element    (the smallest eigenvalue is negative). Then the user might have a few options: 1. all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the  chosen element has the desired correlation in it, but the change in the correlation matrix is the  smallest possible (in the sense of matrix norm) (this is my next step to do for this  spreadsheet). 2. Just one column (and the corresponding row, of course) will change, while  the rest of the matrix will stay unchanged (Kevins suggestion). In this case the user have to  choose which column (and row) he prefers to modify (in my example - column-row 1 or column-row 3).  We can discuss this approach with Risk Control and see how they like it. I  send you only the spreadsheet with an example now.  Tanya.

Please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so, the RC  code & co# for me to allocate your cost share.  Please indicate your choice  of the three cost choices.  Attached note below clarifies Potens proposal on the $10,000/yr subscription. Essentially we have three choices: 1.  for $2700/yr, the standard edition (11 issues, excluding the monthly  special feature article) 2.  for $3800/yr the premium edition, (standard edition PLUS the monthly  special feature article, as in three attached examples) 3. for $10,000/yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for  36 months.  Poten explains that 85% of their subscribers take the premium service.  No  one has ever asked for the $10,000/yr long-term price forecast.  I have an  interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to  others in the corporation. The example copies attached include the following Special Feature articles: 99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean 99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere 99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile One either takes all or none of them for the incremental $1100/yr.

As discussed, Poten is pleased to offer Enron the following two-part fuel-oil related service:  (1) a one-year subscription to Potens Fuel Oil in World Markets (Premium Edition), and  (2) a forecast of delivered crude prices and fuel oil prices in Northwest Europe (Brent and 1%S FOB fuel oil), the Mediterranean (Bonny Light and 1%S FOB fuel oil), and Singapore (Dubai and HSFO-380 cSt).  The forecasts would be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price projections over the forward 36-month period. The forecast prices would be accompanied by brief textual commentary.  The forecasts would be issued over the course of the one-year Fuel Oil in World Markets subscription period.  The fee for the two-part service is US$10,000, payable in two equal installments  I look forward to hearing from you.  Best regards,  Larry  L.

Attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month  price forecasts.  The cost is $3800/yr. As an added service for a total of $10,000/yr, Poten will include a quarterly  update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and FO prices with a brief  justification for their view.  This would include the standard monthly price  forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24  months for Far East, Med and NWE.

I have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price  forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself  regarding the utility of such a report.  The best way to show your  recommendation is with money.  If it is not worth any money to anyone else in  ENE, then I have to question its validity and utility to me as well.

As discussed, Poten is pleased to offer Enron the following two-part fuel-oil related service:  (1) a one-year subscription to Potens Fuel Oil in World Markets (Premium Edition), and  (2) a forecast of delivered crude prices and fuel oil prices in Northwest Europe (Brent and 1%S FOB fuel oil), the Mediterranean (Bonny Light and 1%S FOB fuel oil), and Singapore (Dubai and HSFO-380 cSt).  The forecasts would be provided four times a year and provide average quarterly price projections over the forward 36-month period. The forecast prices would be accompanied by brief textual commentary.  The forecasts would be issued over the course of the one-year Fuel Oil in World Markets subscription period.  The fee for the two-part service is US$10,000, payable in two equal installments  I look forward to hearing from you.  Best regards,  Larry  L.

Attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month  price forecasts.  The cost is $3800/yr. As an added service for a total of $10,000/yr, Poten will include a quarterly  update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and FO prices with a brief  justification for their view.  This would include the standard monthly price  forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24  months for Far East, Med and NWE.  (I expect a more descriptive email from  Poten, but I think this is the essence of their custom offer.)  The example copies attached include the following Special Features: 99Feb - Analysis of Resid Trades in the Eastern Mediterranean 99Sep - Patterns of Fuel Oil Trade in the Western Hemisphere 99Dec - Analysis of the Resid Market in Chile These type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects  related to fuel oil.  I have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price  forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself  regarding the utility of such a report.  The best way to show your  recommendation is with money.  If it is not worth any money to anyone else in  ENE, then I have to question its validity and utility to me as well.

According to DISG 24 Tagging Constraint Trades (21 Dec 99) Option  3(a) [the option that is proposed to be adopted], paragraph 2.3 (p.4):  In the relevant Settlement Period, all accepted Offers and Bids volumes that  can be arbitraged, i.e. where a volume has been bid higher than the price at  which a volume has been offered, are eliminated;  One of the implications of the above procedure is that the highest bids (the  McCoy bids) and the lowest offers (the McCoy offers) are likely to be  eliminated from the calculation of imbalance prices. This will make it harder  to pursue the McCoy strategy successfully.  Thoughts and comments welcome.  Thanks,  Eklavya.

Australia	<23743008.1075857010428.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Energy Derivatives	Hi Vince,  Hope all is well with you. Im looking forward to seeing you again next week and meeting with Grant. Can you guys do me  favour? Im sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an overview of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter?  Im including what I have already written so that you can see the style.  Many thanks and best regards.  Chris.    2 Overview of this Book  This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book.  In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.  Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson of Enron Capital and Trade .  Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves.  What we do in this chapter  Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.  Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps.  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style options.  Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options.  Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions. In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also discussed.  Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables.  Finally, we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11.

The basic idea is as follows:  dirty price_{ith gilt} = Sum_{j} C_{i}/2*discount factor(t_{j,i} )+  100*discount factor(t_{Ni, i}  Using a five parameters analytical form for the discount factors, and  minimizing the sum of absolute errors, I can derive a smooth zero curve.   The model needs an  initial guess for the parameters, this may require some experience. The log file can help  you to see how well the optimization works.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Techmemos	<3510465.1075857036140.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Storage Model: Simple Issues	Brad,  Here are my thoughts on your concerns.  * You needs curve inputs.  This is an IT job.  I can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up.  * Intrinsic value vs Time value:    The intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes.  If you have a  rough idea about the allocation as   you did in the spreadsheet, we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model.    The difference between the    total and the intrinsic will be the (option) time value. However, by  pre-allocating volumes, you killed some options.      In the storage model, volumes are allocated dynamically, therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs. time value.   * Factor of loading:  Factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix. The three factors correspond to   paralle shift, slopping and curveture.  The covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form         COVAR = row( vol_{i} ) *( Correl(i,j) )* Colum( vol_{j} ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve.      (Correl (i,j)) =L*L +residue (small)    where L is the factor of loading matrix.  So in a simple words, the factor of  loadings (say, 60x3) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix (say, 60x60).  Let me know if I can offer further help.  Zimin          Brad Horn                02/15/2000 07:15 AM  To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Sandra Henderson/HOU/ECT@ect  Subject: Storage Model: Simple Issues  Zimin:  Thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation.  Your right to  point out the similarity to market bids.  Here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration:  Model Infrastructure/IT Support: I obviously need to re-build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location.  Short-term  (aprox 1 month), Id like to establish a link to the ENA database EGSPROD32  in order to fetch the long-dated price and volatility curves.  My link to ENA  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new Bridgeline entity (database name and data structure yet to be  defined).  However, its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model.  Any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated.  Ill then work with Sandra  Henderson, an Enron employee providing our IT support, to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases.   Meanwhile, is there anything you think you can do to ensure Im up and running  quickly?  SANDRA: linking EXCEL spreadsheets to Bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects, not just the storage model supplied by Research.  Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Value: it would be helpful to decompose the models  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic (time or  option) value.  I could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value,  and then through a simple  difference I could  determine the extrinsic value.  Ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review.  I wanted to  share this with you to ask the following: does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed? do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode C-code via .dll in order to ensure run-time is faster?    My goal here is straightforward: a) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities.; and b) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads.    Factor Loadings: What are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how I should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated?  Factor loadings have always been a mystery to me.  For  example, what problems should I be looking for as a warning against  mispricing?  What, if anything, is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re-shapings (after all, curve-reshapings are key to storage  valuation!!!)?  Calibration: we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs.  Ill share the  data when we are and model results once Im up and running.

Thanks, Grant. ---------------------- Forwarded by Grant Masson/HOU/ECT on 02/16/2000 02:48  PM ---------------------------   Chris Strickland <chris_strickland@compuserve.com> on 02/15/2000 05:28:42 AM To: Grant Masson@ECT, vkamins@ect cc:   Subject: Energy Book    Hi Grant,  Hope all is well with you. I trust you got my message via the voicemail that Ileft with Vince late Friday afternoon about my inability to travel - Im trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of weeks time when my ear has cleared up, and I look forward to meeting with you one day.  I wrote to Vince last week asking for a favour, but Im not sure ifhe is there in Houston. I know that you guys are probably very busy but I was wondering if you can write a few sentences for me. Im sending out some sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an overview of the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please write a sentence or two for your chapter?  Im including what I have already written (although I think it has changed slightly from this version) so that you can see the style.  Many thanks and best regards.  Chris.    2 Overview of this Book  This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the book.  In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.  Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of  Enron Corporation, discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity  markets. This chapter builds on the previous one.  It examines in detail the methods, merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process  assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2.  Examples  from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to illustrate the  technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility.  Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves.  What we do in this chapter  Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.  Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model with jumps.  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style options.  Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options.  Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions. In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also discussed.  Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables.

Australia	<322832.1075857010357.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	follow up	Mark,  Over the past several months Vince and Paul have had some contact with the  authors of this upcoming risk management book.  Vince and his group are  writing a chapter and the forward, and Enron Australia will contribute  AUS$10,000 in support of the book.  There are a number of apparent legal  issues associated with completing/publicizing this book and Marge suggested  that this is an area of interest to you.  I handle public relations for  APACHI and will try to contact you within the next couple of days to seek  your guidance.  Thanks,  John ---------------------- Forwarded by John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on  02/23/2000 08:37 PM ---------------------------   Lacima <Lacima@compuserve.com> on 02/21/2000 12:29:28 PM To: John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:    Subject: follow up    Hi John,  Nice talking with you last week.  The following are some of the items that we discussed during own phone call:  -  attached is a copy of the introduction of the book.  section 1.2 provides a content overview  -  we are planning to market the book globally, and feel the market size  is around 3000 -  the authors names are Dr Chris Stickland and Dr Les Clewlow   -  Mini bio of authors:  Dr. Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland hold Associate Research Positions at both the School of Finance and Economics, University of Technology, Sydney and the Financial Options Research Centre, University of Warwick, UK.  Together, they have over 20 years combined experience in the financial and energy derivative markets and have published many articles in academic and trade journals.  They are the authors of the book Implementing Derivatives Models (Wiley, 1998) and editors of Exotic Options: The State of the Art (ITP, 1998).  Their forthcoming book Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management is due to be published during the second quarter 2000.  Currently, their interests are concentrated in the energy derivatives area, where they have developed a wide range of pricing tools for electricity options and other energy derivatives.   Could you please provide responses to the following: -  Would it be OK if we use the logo for Enron, the global company? -  What will you need from us before printing?  If you need to review the book jacket or the manuscript, please let us know. -  If Enron needs to review anything, how long will it take for Enron to turn it around? -  We are putting together a leaflet advertising our energy course.  We would like to mention the forthcoming book and that it is being sponsored by Enron...is this OK with you?  No logo will be used. -  We would like to produce a leaflet / brochure advertising the book as well, but this will follow after we have the book cover designed.  Should I work with Andrew at Stokes Account Ex. on this?  -  How do we handle the money side of things?     The manuscript is not fully completed, but we may begin typesetting any day now.  I think it will take about 3-4 weeks to typeset and then another 3 weeks to print and bind.  Sometime in late April? It looks like we will be in Houston around the 7th of March...will you be around either the 7th or 8th?  I hope you are enjoying your time at home.  Let me know if you need anything further.

Techmemos	<16532394.1075857036096.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Removal of Caps on Resale of Transmission	On March 16, Martin Lin will be participating in a panel discussion with Dick  ONeill of FERC, a rep. of Morgan Stanley, and Ed Cazalet of APX on Market  Turmoil, Trading and Risk Management (Harvard Electricity Group).  At the  present time, except in several limited regions, marketers do not have the  ability to hedge transmission risk by reselling it above cost.  Last year, we  approached Dick ONeills staff about the possibility of lifting the cap on  resales of transmission, but they were not inclined to proceed absent the use  of certain restrictions.  There have been several recent developments in  power and gas, as discussed in the attached memo.  It would be helpful for  Martin to discuss these recent orders as necessary in order to attempt to  gain support from Dick ONeill for the idea of lifting the cap for power.   After Martins discussion, we should consider reapproaching FERC to seek  approval.

Projects	<7166705.1075857033081.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Meeting for Friday on Storage	Hi Mark, I have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you.  = I would like to discuss with you and possibly with John Bloomer and Richard=  Reichardt about the EBS Researchs role in supporting the Storage market development from the origination and trading perspective.  There are severa= l people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is whats = my take on our involvement--please correct me or suggest otherwise.   Shalesh Ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort.  In addition to his effo= rt with your group, he is presently supporting Jean Mrha with pricing and standardization for a traded storage maret--Stinson Gibner is directly supervising him in this effort.  Shalesh came to us through referal from David Cox--David discovered him at=  one of his speaking engagements.  Shalesh had talked to David about traded=  storage market development some time last October and David refered Shalesh=  to Enron Research group. We hired Shalesh for general analyst position and=  now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort.  Currently, he is=  our point person (with Stinson or I supervising his effort) who is supporti= ng Jean Mrha and you on the subject.  Kara Knop has aproached Shalesh with request for some support and Shalesh and she are sorting out each other=01,= s role in this regard.  As per my discussion today with David, we need to coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market assessment etc. For this I suggest Shalesh and his effort so that all parti= es involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source.  Bas= ed on Davids and my assessment of Shaleshs capabilities, I would like to suggest that the commercial heads use Shalesh for his creative thinking, understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for da= ta gathering and simple research effort. We can add other staff as we see the=  need and as you request them.  Please respond this e-mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan, so=  that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner.  Kind Regards,  Ravi.   A bit about EBS Research Group  John Bloomer and Richard Reichardt have met me and are aware of my role and=  Stinston Gibners role in EBS. I lead a team of quantitative professionals=  via a group we are calling EBS Research.  This group reports to Stinson Gibner (VP) and Vince Kaminski (MD and Head of Enron Research).  Stinson an= d Vince are the original founders of Enron Corp Research that has been charge= d with model development efforts to support Enron Energy trading and other Enron business.  Enron Research is involved in all aspects of Enron buiness= es (EES, International, Corporate affairs such as FAS 133 and other accounting=  and new product (derivatives) development, etc.).  Within EBS Research, there serveral professionals supporting Kevin Howard=  (CFO office), John Griebling, Tom Gros and Jean Mrha, David Cox (via Boris)= , and the War room.  Our main area of focus is with Jean Mrha (trading) and=  John Griebling (optical network design and optimization, etc.).  We play a=  key role with John Grieblings go forward network design and implementation=  through our responsiblity to provide traffic engineering analysis and modeling effort.   ----- Forwarded by Ravi Thuraisingham/Enron Communications on 03/08/00 09:3= 1 AM -----  Shalesh Ganjoo@ECT 03/07/00 08:01 PM   To: Mark S Palmer/Enron Communications@Enron Communications  cc: Ravi Thuraisingham/Enron Communications@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS@ENR= ON  Subject: Meeting for Friday on Storage  Dear Mark,  I am looking forward to presenting my competitive analysis on the Storage=  market on Friday to you and others.

London	<12871486.1075857050712.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book - Final Version	Dear all,  Attached is Anjams reasoning and final version of the UK PPI PLLU model.   The UK Inflation Books main exposure is to two PPI indexes - the PLLU and  the DZCV through year 2010. Both are PPI Output indexes with very comparable  baskets. The only significant difference between the two is the presence of  energy in the PLLU (7.6%). The model in use escalates the two indexes by the  same factors. However, with the energy price fluctuations in recent years  different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their  drivers. Anjam concentrated on the PLLU index first and he will shortly  construct one for the DZCV based on the same methodology, but without the  Brent Crude curve.   The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is  significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is  considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients. This will result in us  having more confidence in our monthly P&L as well as less fluctuations.   Best regards,  Martina  x34327      Anjam Ahmad 10/03/2000 11:59 To: Martina Angelova/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book  Dear all,  I followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as  follows:-  1) USE LESS DATA  Unfortunately, kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less  robust, in fact dramatically so, and so eliminates the possibility of using  less data.  The model tested was the RPI(month+15) & Deviations from  long-term average for Brent Crude.  The r-squared and F-statistic collapsed  by eliminating the first 12 months of data.  2) DEVIATIONS IN CRUDE VARIABLE  Shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by 3 and 6  months did not alter the model goodness-of-fit parameters dramatically and so  my suggestion is that we stick with the following model:  PLLU[t] = a.RPI[t] + b.RPI[t+15] + c.BrentCrudeDeviations[t] + Constant  3) TESTING MODEL WITH SINE WAVE  To gauge the response of the model to wildly-varying RPI forward curve, a  sine wave of period 3 years for RPI was input into the PPI model.  The result  was as expected; PPI pre-empts the moves in RPI by about 8 months.  The  magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced.  This shows that if we had  more detail in our RPI forward curve, then the PPI model would reflect those  peaks and humps adequately.    CONCLUSION  I therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates RPI, RPI[t+15]  and deviations of Brent Crude from long-term average.  The new model is  plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old PPI which is  depicted in blue.    Please note that all this analysis only applies to PLLU, and that a separate  study will be needed for the DZCV PPI index.

The three new equations developed were:-  PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + c.(DatedBrentCrude - 18.8) + constant,  where N is 14,15 or 16 [REDDISH CURVES] r-squared approx 0.49 F-stat approx 32  The chart below shows what our projected PLLU curve would be given this  equation, and also the three best relations from before which were based upon  current and future RPI:  PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + constant, where N is 14,15 or 16 [GREENISH CURVES] r-squared approx 0.47 F-stat approx 45  COMPARISON OF MODELS As you can see, the two equations differ in the very short-term and very  long-term; the inclusion of deviations of Brent Crude leads to short-term  predictions of 3.0% to 3.2% over the next six months.  The greenish curves  predict PLLU in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% over the next six months.  The curves are then very similar until 2009, when the models including crude  break-away to the upside, relative to the falling RPI curve.  The model based  purely on RPI hugs the RPI curve much more closely in the longer term.  This  is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009  (which we dont).  SUGGESTION What could be useful now is a differently-specified model designed to  forecast only the next 3 months, using auto-regressive or auto-regressive  error terms.  This model would be far more accurate in the near-term, and we  could include this information onto the front of this long-term model.  This  may be useful, despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time  buckets.    BACK-TESTING  All the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data  sample used (based mainly on 1990s new paradigm economy).    Hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele-conference;  your ideas on this would be appreciated.

Stanford	<22385884.1075857071948.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Visit to Enron	Tom,  I am forwarding to you a copy of the message from Nick Bambos. I shall try to  catch you  for a few minutes today (Monday) to close the loop on this effort.

I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the technical level and otherwise.  I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was clearer. Lets see if we can get a match with your schedule - mine is rather terrible:  Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.  Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be important for the student support funds to be in place then, so that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing soft commitments to star-level students to get this research and its potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this competition.  Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May. I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets going. Please let me know what you think.

Projects	<19345821.1075857032963.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Daily Rates - Jackups	John:  Claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composed  jackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups and  semis. He did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from a  simpler index price calculation by taking the straight average.   The results show a good R-square between the general index and individual  jackup categories - on the range of 0.7 - 0.8. Only one category displayed a  poor R-square - about 0.3. For semis of 4tht and 5th generation, however, we  noticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - R-squares about 0.2 - 0.3.  You may verify each regression by changing the choice cell (AX2 on Analysis).   Claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages,  12 month swaps on gas / crude, and rigs utilization explains the daily rates.  We will forward the results as soon as we finish.     Please call me or Claudio if you have questions.

London	<24423409.1075857050686.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	New Businesses in London: Weather & Insurance	Hi Vince,  Talking to the staff in London, I heard that Lynda Clemmons and a few of the  key Weather Desk members left to start their own business.  I am hearing that  London may gain more independence from Houston and gain its own book and,  interestingly, also having ideas about developing the insurance/ insurance  derivatives market.  I therefore thought this might be a useful opportunity  to formalise a gradual transfer of responsibility for weather deal pricing  from Joe to myself plus start talking to Vasant about the new markets on the  insurance side.

Techmemos	<18628786.1075857036047.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Choosing the Riskfree Rate	Dear all,  I completeley agree with Ben that Treasuries are the most liquid and reliable  benchmarks. I also think that FMAs have their own advantages and  disadvantages.  However, it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using LIBOR  as benchmark - at least to price anything related to Capital Markets (for  example, credit default swaps) . Our prices will always be different from  that on Capital Markets if we use benchmarks different from the Market.  As a half-way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example, use  anything, that we decide is closest to risk-free, to value products  significantly different from that priced on Capital markets,and LIBOR for  everything priced on Capital Markets .   We can adjust by manipulating other coefficients (event, liquidity,  recovery) for our purposes, but it looks like benchmark should be LIBOR.  To avoid negative default probabilites (for highly rated reference entities)  we can add cost fo repo and haircuts (as all bankers do).  Let us continue our discussion on this.

My preliminary conclusions  are as follows:  Recent turmoil in the Treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30-year bonds. Treasuries are still the most liquid curve, and that used by banks for  benchmarking risky debt. There is a considerable a liquidity/scarcity premium inherent within the  corporate-Treasury spread, which we are not taking into account. More  accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy  prices based on Treasuries, which are consistent with the market.  All further comments are welcome of course.

Hes extremely interested in moving to Enron,  and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research,  although far broader than his investment banking quant experience.  He  remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but  wants to look at new markets and products.  I think we should seriously  consider hiring him.  He is (understandably) reluctant to move to Houston,  but theres no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives  pricing (and thinking) here in London.  Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple  of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him?

Projects	<10864119.1075857032917.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: EOTT Options	Tracy,  Attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both Black-Scholes and  American option valuation models.   These are the generally accepted methods  for valuation of options on equity.   The European option prices assume  that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity, while the  American style options can be exercised at any time during their life.     I have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market  value of $13.00 and that the options are struck at this level.   The  volatility input is the other main assumption.   EOTT has been trading  recently with a volatility ranging between 30% to 40% although looking  further back, the range is much wider.  To run the model, you must be linked with the options library.   I am not  sure what lan you are connected with, but you can coordinate with Zimin Lu  (x36388) for help with loading the option library add-in module.   On the ENA  lan it is located under  O:\research\exotica\xll\exotica.xll.    This is  loaded in excel using the Tools/Add-Ins and Browse to reach the add-in  location.  --Stinson x34748    P.S.   I will mail you a hard-copy of a plot showing recent EOTT volatility  as well.   If you would like us to help you in running specific examples,  please let me, Vince, or Zimin know.

London	<29734813.1075857050597.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Spanish Power Option Pricing	Hi Paul/Cassim,  Further to our meeting yesterday regarding power options, that we may use to  capture short-term volatility from regulatory caps being adhered to or  broken, I have attached a spreadsheet that should assist in nailing down the  value.  ARBITRARY DISTRIBUTION The first issue to address is converting the price scenarios for the average  of the Q2-Q3 swap into a volatility equivalent.  This is achieved by fitting  a normal distribution that matches the one specified for mean and standard  deviation.  The graph below illustrates the method for the numbers discussed  yesterday.  In this example, the annualised volatility is coming up as  approximately 23%.    PRICING & IMPLIED VOLATILITY The pricing is as for a regular Asian option.  The payoff depends on the  average of the daily prices for Spanish power for Q2 and Q3.  The valuation  using 23% volatility is showing about 15.3 Pta per kWh.  I will schedule a meeting to allow us to take this forward.

London	<8221177.1075857050575.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	UK Inflation and Storage model	Hi Zimin,  INFLATION: I am also spending a lot of time looking at short-term auto-regressive models  for PPI and long-term, more fundamentally-based models.  This work is  important because we have potentially a large positive P&L that may be  unlocked by moving to our new indicative UK PPI curves.  John Sherriff and  Trena are keen that any models I produce are vetted/approved in Houston, so I  will forward to Stinson or yourself initially for review once ready and  documented.  STORAGE: Thanks for the current storage  model.  Due to the complexity of the  modelling issues involved, I would strongly support a visit by you to help me  meet the needs of the London customers in this matter, and am happy to act as  the anchor for information flow in the mean time.  Regards,  Anjam x35383     Zimin Lu 21/03/2000 19:31 To: Anjam Ahmad/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: US inflation and Storage model     Anjam,  Thanks a lot.  After getting that book I will redo the US inflation model.   Our exposure to CPI inflation risk is huge (think about how many contracts signed by EES),  so the US model is very important.  The storage model is going through aduit by Prof. D. Duffie. We are adding  features to it.   I can send you the current version. Maybe it is worthwhile for me to  go to London to discuss with the users about the valuation.

London	<3955468.1075857050551.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	PPI Index Short-Term Models	Hi Martina & Trena,  I made a few minor changes to the models...  I reckon these models can be  checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets)  and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I  became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether  this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the  forecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:    Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just  copied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is  not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable  confidence.  As I mentioned, I dont think we can really run this model more  than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the  next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.

I received the same email last week and the request has been  taken care of.  In fact, he had a very short time line for the request  and  had subsequently used outside forecasts for the bid.

Techmemos	<11243134.1075857035908.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: the research lunch	I would be very willing to make a presentation to you.  This coming Thursday  unfortunately, I have a sick day scheduled (babies will do this kind of thing  to you) and will not come into the office.  Would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a  few (possibly) interested individuals?  This might give us more shceduling  flexibility and would also seem more appropriate, knowing that what I have is  a set of suggestions for development and no earth-shuttering, live product.  Please let me know if this accomodates your needs,  Yannis     Joseph Hrgovcic 03/29/2000 09:35 AM To: Yannis Tzamouranis/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: the research lunch   Yannis,   Shirley will know the room in which the lunch is scheduled. Let her know  what audio-visual materials youll need. Keep in mind that the research group  is now about 40 people, some of whom will be watching the presentation on  video from Portland and from London. The best platform would be to get a  PC-video or PC-screen link-up, so that everyone, including people watching  remotely, can see your computers monitor on a big screen.   The itinerary for the lunch is that we meet at 11:30 and eat lunch and trade  news for the first 30-45 minutes, and then at 12:00 or 12:30 at the latest,  we have a presentation. We try to wrap up by 1:00, so that what we discussed  yesterday should make for a very good presentation in pretty much every way.  From my experience, the audio-visual people need at least an hour advance  warning to get the screens linked up. Let me know if you need any help in  getting you and Jenny the things you need.

London	<4608127.1075857050462.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Norway Visit: Research Agenda	Dear All,  I would like to make myself available for some meetings at the Oslo office  during my visit on Friday pm, Monday and Tuesday.  I believe Bjarne will be  available on Tuesday, if not Monday, and so would like to arrange the Trading  and Origination meetings for Tuesday (so that he can attend) and maybe go  through the EnergyDesk issues on Monday.  I will also give a presentation,  probably on Monday.  TRADING: OPTIONS & VOLATILITY CURVES It would be useful to meet with the traders along with Bjarnes team to help  us improve our understanding of the valuation/hedging issues encountered in  trading options (both European and Asian).  I hope to discuss the vol curves  and will bring the example of the recent work done for the UK electricity  desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half-hourly  forward volatility curve have been developed.  ORIGINATION: Any issues arising in complex deals (e.g. dry reservoir, user-time contracts)  etc. perhaps with Didrik.  ENERGYDESK.COM To support the on-going effort to ensure the accuracy of the EnergyDesk.com  systems, I hope to help James Stephen nail-down the reasons for some of the  discrepancies between the EnergyDesk.com valuation and the Oslo book (for  this I hope to meet with Trond).  EXOTIC OPTIONS: If everything runs smoothly, I plan to roll-out the new Asian model which  should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve.

Techmemos	<27791333.1075857035884.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	US Gas Storage Growth	Huge Growth in Natural Gas Storage Tracked       As the natural gas market approaches 30 Tcf per year, demand for natural gas storage capacity will rise exponentially.  Although the snowball has just started rolling, current plans by natural storage operators will boost working capacity by 430 Bcf, or 10%, and will raise peak-day deliverability 11.8 Bcf per day, or 13.8%, according to a new survey by Intelligence Press. Intelligence Press new multimedia research package provides a comprehensive look at all current activity on 458 storage fields with additional key information on 101 LNG facilities. Among them are 38 proposed natural gas storage fields and 15 storage expansion projects. Depleted fields capture the largest share of the proposed fields with 24, followed by aquifers with six, and salt domes and salt beds with four each. Altogether the proposed new fields account for about 329 Bcf in working capacity and 9.7 Bcf per day in deliverability.  Proposed and potential expansions represent an increase of about 100.5 Bcf of working capacity and 2.1 Bcf per day in deliverability. But these projects are just the tip of the iceberg. Regulatory changes, shifting natural gas flows and increases in demand due to growth in the economy and particularly in natural gas fired power generation are expected to cause significant additional storage growth in the next decade.

I reckon these models can be  checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets)  and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I  became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether  this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the  forecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:    Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just  copied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is  not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable  confidence.  As I mentioned, I dont think we can really run this model more  than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the  next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.  Hope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!

All rights   reserved.     Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have   been somewhat slow to get off the ground.    Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since   the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a   significant volume of trades.    Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away   from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains   abundant and relatively cheap.    As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major   natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will   remain limited, observers say.    Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the   limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he   said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one   contract against another.    Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to   establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has   not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,   capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in   New York.    The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not   offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way   to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified   portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently   offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that   hedge, he said.    Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then   hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.   stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane   explained.    The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to   natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he   said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop   indexes, Mr. Lane said. For the insurance buyer, such exchange   instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but   as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a   good surrogate, he said.    The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for   over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of   catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.    The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of   exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior   vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance   brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.    The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not   looking for other ways of doing business, he said.    At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar   to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success   since they were introduced in the 1970s. There is a belief that   alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to   predict when, Mr. Mooney said.    Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves   established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not   brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.    Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities   Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,   however, and was suspended last year after two years of little   activity.    The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative   products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board   of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.    Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft   traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge   catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker   at the CBOT who trades in options.    No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT   so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in   the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were   traded, Mr. Purty said.    I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they   really take off, he said.    The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to   trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance   markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative   coverage options, Mr. Purty said.    The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has   radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in   mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,   chief operating officer.    CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for   reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks   and to build balanced portfolios.    But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it   was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX   wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney   said.    Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of   risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.   Sweeney said.    Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a cash for cover   exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange   include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability   coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where   coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry   loss over an agreed threshold.    Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible   through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX   offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them   form groups whose members do business only with one another.    Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,   totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,   he said. CATEXs roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,   insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their   captives, Mr. Sweeney said.    We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied   with what we have achieved so far, Mr. Sweeney said.    The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents   seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their   existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was   a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last   year.    Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field   of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather   derivatives .    Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry   Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.    Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against   weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in   a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a   resultant fall in revenues.    The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,   Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,   Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering   contracts based on cold weather.    Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers   themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more   extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.    In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for   over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.     Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

As promised, I am enclosing our executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays, and they would provide good management skills I believe.

Our impression here in Houston is that Thomas  is quite qualified  and we are very interested in him. A few days will not make much difference  in the hiring process.  Vince      Steven Leppard 04/17/2000 03:50 AM To: Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Thomas Knudsen  Dale, Vince  As you all know I have attempted to get Thomas Knudsen interviewed as a  result of Prof Lane Hughstons recommendation (Lane is an acquaintance of  Vince and me, and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance).   Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was too old and too  experienced.  Since I felt that Thomas has some merit, I asked Houston to  have an informal chat with Thomas.  Houston wish to pursue the interview  process further, and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews.  Im  somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this, since it  seems hes trying to put up barriers to these interviews.  I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he  recounts some strange conversations with Anjam.  He says he received a call  from Anjam on Thursday (13th April) evening (outside office hours), asking  how he got his CV into Enron (Id shown Anjam the email and CV back in early  February), and how Anjam could contact him (despite the fact he was  contacting him at that moment).  Anjam then called Thomas on his work number (bad form) on Friday 14th asking  Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday (one working days notice).   Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week, and that  hed have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things  at work.  He said hed contact Anjam on Monday (today) to confirm his  availability.  Today (17th April) Thomas called Anjam to say he couldnt make it, and that  he wouldnt be able to make it for two weeks (not so serious, he thought,  given that were losing time to Easter anyway).  Anjam told Thomas that the  position might be filled in two weeks time.  Thomas is concerned about missing the boat, and I for one didnt even realise  it was leaving so soon!  Can anyone shed any light on this?

Techmemos	<15334063.1075857035794.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Japanese Power Market	Another article I thought you might find interesting.  Regards,    Eugenio  Review of energy policies kicks off     Asahi Shimbun   April 25, 2000   A government advisory panel on Monday embarked on a comprehensive review of energy-related policies.   ``We want to come up with feasible policies and at the same time clearly present reasons for those policies, Yoichi Kaya, a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, told a meeting of the Coordination Subcommittee under the Advisory Committee for Energy, an advisory panel to Minister of International Trade and Industry Takashi Fukaya. Kaya chairs the subcommittee.   The nuclear development policy, including the governments goal for building new nuclear power plants, is expected to be a focus of the discussions.   A spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of plants increasingly difficult, and the nations power suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20 to 13.   The subcommittee, set up for the first time in about 10 years, is made up of about 30 members, and members of anti-nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been included for the first time.   Some members told Mondays meeting that the government must stop taking the nuclear development policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility of introducing renewable energy, such as wind and solar power.   Also on the agenda will be energy saving measures.   Energy consumption in the residential and commercial sector, made up of homes and offices, and in the transportation sector, which includes cars and trucks, has almost doubled over the past 25 years.   At Mondays meeting, many members stressed the need to change public consciousness toward the use of energy.   MITI plans to present studies on how life would be affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as automatically turning off air conditioners at certain temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle.

London	<32036219.1075857050100.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Response from Lenos	Steve,  I shall E-mail you my standard real option spin presentation + plus a  presentation on Enron (for analysts). You can use a few slides to  introduce the company.  I would prefer not to disseminate the information about the  use of AMC. The  industry does not know about it yet and I consider it a very  powerful tool (given its flexibility).  I have the files on my laptop. I shall bring it to work to morrow and send it to you.  Please, remind me about it on Thursday (old age and the hectic pace here start showing up).  Vince       Steven Leppard 04/26/2000 05:09 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Response from Lenos  Vince  Lenos got back to me, and said hed prefer a high-level overview of real  options in Enron, perhaps using my notation to express the ideas.  He wants  me to keep away from the technicalities of my work.  Would you send me your (usual) powerpoint presentation on real options, and  Ill look at manipulating it to include my diagrams.  My own efforts to date  have been on fairly limited power plant modelling/asset development, and I  obviously dont have the high-level view you have.  This will ensure I get  the full range of real option type deals in my presentation.  If required I could present the real option problems I have analysed, namely: 1. Maintenance scheduling in power plant operation; 2. Gas storage; 3. Power plant asset development, which would include (1) as a sub-tree.  I will also need your advice on whether I can talk about the fact that we  prefer American Monte Carlo to build our trees.  I havent used AMC myself up  till now, Ive been carrying out static optimizations, with different price  curve scenarios being run through.  Im still working on selling the full stochastic dynamic programming approach  - people are just getting to the stage of accepting my deterministic DP, and  theyre still being supplied with useful products, as per my Real Options  Strategy document.

This adds up to o525 for the sub-set in blue; alternatively we can  stick to 103 through 106 for o356 -> I suggest we go for the smaller sub-set  to start off with.

I think that we should go for one contiguous  stay per person and make a good effort to make these trips productive.

The deadline for  submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so theres less of a  hurry.  As regard our summer visits, well need to speak to Dale over the budget.   Personal commitments mean its difficult for me to take two whole months to  visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter  visit.  Id obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the  only way I can do it.  I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee.  Ive persuaded Richard to pay for Matts visit in its entirety, and Ive no  doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee.   Its difficult to think whod be the natural group to pay for me.  I honestly  think Ill have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that its worth his  while to pay for my visit.  I get the impression he thinks Im doing OK  without the need to go to Houston for further training.

The best hotel is either Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree  Downtown (it is important to emphasize Downtown when making reservations). The hotels are within a walking distance from  the Enron building.  We can make reservations  for dinner around 6:30 - 7:00 in a resturant  within 10 minutes by car from the hotel.

Projects	<22174922.1075857032537.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Independent Variables for ENE Regressions	Brad,  As we discussed, its very difficult to find drivers of the ENE stocks  behaviours.  We investigated about 30 comparable stocks, 10 capital market  indices, and three energy commodity indices.  Regular regressions as well as  regressions with different legs and leads were performed.  Some variables  show significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods,  but most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different  or longer time periods.   Only two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and  DOW Jones Utility  Index(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a  summary of these relationship can be found in the attached file  outputSummary).  But as you can see, the R2 are below 30%.  Also, the ?Durbin-Watson statistics tell us to be careful about autocorrelation.?Basically, the regression analysis so far confirms our original opinion -- ?its hard, if not impossible, to find out any real driver of the ENE stock.  ?After Enron added new core business several month ago, the stock behaved more ?or less like a tele_comm stock,  which suggests that ENRON stock has entered ?into a new phase.  To capture, at least  trying to capture,  its ?characteristics in the new phase, we need a lit bit more time to cumulate the ?market date.??Let me know if you need me investigate more variables or you come up with ?some new thoughts.????Vincent??

Projects	<3329411.1075857032514.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: LNG May 19 decision	John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Becks organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enrons LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, lets say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.

Skilling <sreinar@enron.com> cc: Vince J Kaminski <vkamins@ect.enron.com>, Robert A. Jarrow  <raj15@cornell.edu>, Robert C. Merton <rmerton@hbs.edu>   Subject:    Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling President and C.O.O., Enron Corp.  Dear Jeff,  This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hope you recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my 1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted to introduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing an innovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers Kuppuswamy Seshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal founders of SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the companys Scientific Advisory Board. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during your keynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG and has been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch with JP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. Ed Colloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O. of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have huge value-adding opportunities. However, given Eds busy travel schedule, I dont believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision by Bob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.  SKGs solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in electronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (Alternative Trading Systems). It achieves this through a process of strategic negotiation using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations). Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement to any extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Our initial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading, e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/power instruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and other web-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to Enron Online.  SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way: 1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility, bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example, the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidth available, continguity of the allocation, and such.) 2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to static matching. 3) It is multi-lateral. 4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions. 5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do in traditional markets.  Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading at Fidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research, Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey, Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.  We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or any other Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit. SKGs founders and I will be very happy to provide you or your representative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, in a meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange something appropriate.  Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.

As promised, I am enclosing our executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays, and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks again and best regards.  Dale Nesbitt  PS:  You might hear from Drew Ries of your Investments group.

I asked Dave Gorte on Monday to send me one and was not told that he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest substitute.   Vince     John Sherriff 05/16/2000 12:20 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision     Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals  have already been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or  two.  John    Vince J Kaminski 15/05/2000 17:14 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick  Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision    John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Becks organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enrons LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, lets say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.   Vince    John Sherriff 05/14/2000 01:40 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: LNG May 19 decision   Vince  I havent spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.   Anyway with Greg moving to his new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the  Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.  I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far  away).  Anway I understand this is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you  please let me know where you stand now?  I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

In this first visit I was hoping to understand better the research goals of Enron and brainstorm with people about what are the top challenges and opportunities for our research collaboration. Identifying the best research problems in terms of 1) highest innovation potential and 2) highest projected impact would be at the top of my list. It might be unprofessional on my side to talk to an audience that I dont have any prior information about and is very diverse anyway; it could actually be dangerous. I would feel MUCH more comfortable to do that in my second visit, after I have understood the  environment better and I have some results to talk about. I would like to be in a position to impress people when I give my first talk at Enron. (Besides, I will have to prepare good slides for such a talk and I am totally swamped all next week.)  > 3.

The purpose of the FMRC is to stimulate research on financial markets and to provide a link between academic research, real world issues and regulation. Members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research of the center. They send an unlimited number of participants to center conferences. Our center is unique in its mix of academics, practitioners and regulators. For members, such as Enron, it provides a window on the academic world, and would give Enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use of markets in heretofore unusual commodities.  More information on the center can be found at http://mba.vanderbilt.edu/fmrc/  Center members include, NYSE, Nasdaq, CME, some high tech trading firms, Merrill Lynch....  Joining the center usually requires a top management decision, but I would approach it through the research and the trading areas. One way to start is to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to attend this years conference on April 13 -14. The program is on the web site. (Membership is $10,000 per year)  Appreciate your interest and help.  Let me know if we should provide more detail to someone.

He said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but  simply wants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position (a  reiteration of what Rick Buy had said in our meeting today).  I would simply  ask Vinces team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand  alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price  movements.   This would be much easier than the Rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly  look at the value of the options on the other two ships.  In other words we  could look at two ship  long positions with some implied volatilities and  also estimate daily VARs on the ships as if they were mark to market  (although I agree with David that we will not likely be able to mark the  ships because they will be treated as leases).  John   John ---------------------- Forwarded by John Sherriff/LON/ECT on 22/05/2000 19:05  ---------------------------   Joe Gold 22/05/2000 18:58 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Exmar Purchase Decision   John,  After spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil  groups, I have a slightly different angle on the Exmar LNG vessel decision.   I would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do  power and gas positions.  Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury and  sometimes, in absence of true analytics, the most rudimentary measures can  provide the best decision tools.  Here is how we would make the decision:  1)  Our shipping expert confirms that $140 million for a 135,000 ton ship  represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years  and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently.  He also  confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several Far  East buyers and that new LNG orders and other ship building (cruise liners)  have reduced the over capacity.  His experience and historic analysis has  suggested that the pricing cycle for LNG ships lasts for a significant  period.  New efficiency measures should reduce new build prices (and allow  for a lower trough), but not by an extreme amount versus the $140 million  cost of this vessel.     Pierre normally likes to roll time charters; however, this is difficult in an  illiquid shipping market like LNG.  He would purchase this ship if the LNG  shipping book were his to manage.  He estimates the ship could be sold in a  distressed sale for $110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a  long term basis at a value of up to $200 million.    2)  Our development teams in Spain, Italy and Turkey have been trying to  solve the big question - gas.  In each country, the key to developing a  merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating  leverage with the monopoly gas supplier.  It is questionable whether or not  this decision will have an immediate impact on Arcos.  The plants time line  and the realities of the LNG supply market may require that we commit to Gas  Natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured.   The shear  threat of being able to bring spot or term LNG to these markets will improve  our negotiating leverage and/or allow us to create flexibility.  Going  forward, however, other potential plant opportunities in Spain, and elsewhere  in the Med region, may have the capacity to utilise these vessels.   I think  that this flexibility is worth at least $25 million to me.  3)  I would summarise:   Upside   $60 + $25 = $85 million      Downside           ($30) + $25 =             ($5)  million  I would do it.  I will leave the rest to you.

London	<19671327.1075857049784.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Real Options Article	Steve,  The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication than RISK MAgazine.  If the article is published it will give you more exposure in  the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant accomplishment.  On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK among the practitioners.  I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

First, EOL records all index  trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isnt, inadvertently,  recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended the  contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis  trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to  them of the price as the basis, times the quantity.  Im sorry I wasnt ready in time with my numbers; I took the task of accuracy  very seriously.

My only  reservation is that my knowledge of this area is very limited, so it is  likely I would just be an observer, rather than a participant. Anyway just so  that I am adequately prepared could you briefly describe our current  relationship with this project, and also suggest any reading, like a magazine  or paper, that would quickly aid my understanding of the topics to be  discussed.

I wanted to ask you for a favor (on a very short notice). We are talking to  the Wharton School about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or  more  research projects with them.  One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies. The Wharton offers  a  symposium in Paris on June 10  on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you (or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to  evaluate the usefulness of this project.  I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.

Per our discussion, Ive enclosed three files that include an invitation, agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or you can call him at 215-898-1231.  This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that Enrons involvement will give the company access to some of the early research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of the partnership benefits.  Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:  Friday, September 8 WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET? This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited. We will co-sponsor this with Whartons major e-Business initiative. Major issues addresses include New Economics of the Web and Internet, Anywhere.  Friday, October 20 FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES Designed by the ET core group and presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.  As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join the program.  To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the symposium in Paris on June 10 to test drive the program.  Ill send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your convenience, should you agree that Enrons participation in the ET Program would be of value.

London	<20821144.1075856611151.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: INSEAD High-tech Acquisitions Workshop	Ben  Thanks for attending. I was on vacation last week (driving from Ca to  Houston) and could not answer your first message regardoing Insead conference in time.  The objective was to find out more about the he Workshop on High-tech  acquisitions  and evaluate the usefulness of the program for Enron. I shall be making a  recommendation to Jeff Skilling that we should work with Wharton as a partner in a number of different research projects.  I shall try to catch you next week to find out what was said about valuation  of  small high-tech firms.  Vince     Benjamin Parsons 06/12/2000 05:50 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: INSEAD High-tech Acquisitions Workshop  Vince  I attended the Workshop on High-tech acquisitions at Insead on Saturday  alongside participants from Cisco, EADS, Razorfish and Cable+Wireless, and  academics from Insead and Wharton. The basic premise was to discuss and get  feedback from practitioners about the Research Project, and a PhD study which  is currently underway at Wharton. The discussions were very interesting -  especially as this was my first exposure to this area.   Examples of the discussions raised include why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in-house what degree of post-acquisition integration was optimal difficulties of US firms acquiring Euro/Asian high-tech companies how to value small high-tech firms how to quantify the success/failure of an acquisition  My feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to  Enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give  us first-hand access to the results. Plus it would enable us to learn from  the mistakes of others, through meeting practitioners at such workshops and  having greater access to the case studies. I guess it could also aid our  realignment within the high-tech/communication industry to be seen in such  studies.

London	<3550790.1075856611105.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Summary of Last 6 Months Projects	Dear Dale, Stinson & Vince,  I would like to take this opportunity to communicate some information to  summarise the projects of the past six months.  Firstly, by all accounts it  has been an amazing few months for me - I believe that I have kept a large  number of commercial group heads very happy.  However, not all are aware of  my activities, so, many people (e.g. John Sherriff, Richard Lewis, Steve  Young etc.) will not know of everything I have done.  For example the amount  of work that I put into the inflation models and the extent to which I was  critical for the successful building of those curves and the consequent  impact (o7+ million for Q1) and similar large P&L swings for Eastern contract  optionality (short virtual power station) based upon my UK Power Vol Curve  Generator.  For your benefit, I have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on  over the past five/six months:  1) Inflation curve modelling (February and March + April internal audit +  June external audit) 2) UK Power Monthly Vol Curve generator & ideas for half-hourly vol curve 3) Nordic Power Monthly Vol Curve generator 4) Energydesk.com models & support 5) Real Options: options to build/extend power stations (e.g. Wessex deal,  Anti-Freeze project) 6) Continental power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader-specified  distributions) 7) Global products: non-generic options modelling and new commodity forward  curve construction (benzene fwd curve from naphtha) 8) Exotic options library upgrade/model test/bug fixes (e.g. testing new/old  Asian models) 9) Continental gas volatility curve construction 10) Communication objective I: two presentations to Enron Europe staff, one  to Oslo office 11) Communication objective II: meetings to gather information and present  results 12) FAS 133: working with internal and external auditors on matching  financial and physical (accrual) hedges - hedge effectiveness 13) Oslo trip: bringing Oslo up to speed on EXOTICA and option valuation 14) Houston Research staff: co-ordinating communication/meetings to maximise  productivity 15) Valuation/Marketing of Power put options for banks that hold senior and  sub debt in merchant power plant  Meeting breakdown:    Initiated by me & booked into meeting rooms  Attended (initiated by others)  Jan  4       5 Feb  6       5 Mar  23       8 Apr  25       4 May  34       5 Jun  12 (so far)       3  I believe I have kept as many commercial groups happy as is possible; it is  clear that I have been critical to large P&L sensitive projects and hope that  I can continue to help enhance earnings going forward.

I have already contacted intranet development  about updates - they dont have to do much except publish the document and  maybe add some headings, so IT resources are not really a problem.  As you  suggest, what would be great is if we can get some more content in terms of  well-explained introductions to various topics like value-at-risk, credit  risk and so on.  It should not be at too high a level and will probably have  to be written specifically for this purpose.

London	<5039016.1075856610966.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: London Research PRC	Dale,  Thanks for the update. I fully concur with all the rankings. It seems things are going well with the Research Group in London and this is, to a very large extent, your contribution.  I think that Anjam has improved a lot. I dont think, however, that he can run the group in the future. Steve emerged as a natural leader and has overwhelming support in the organization.  Vince       Dale Surbey 06/15/2000 02:28 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: London Research PRC  Vince,  We had the PRC preranking for RAC and Research in London yesterday.  Heres  how everyone came out:  Steven - Superior:  No controversy here.  Steve received consistently strong  feedback (ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories).  The  only rough spot was teamwork, arising from the friction between Anjam and  himself.   Anjam - Excellent:  Anjam received rankings of Superiors or Excellents in all  categories.  Several reviewers commented that Anjams performance in the  areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have  improved.  I felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on  this feedback, even though in terms of leadership I dont rate him high  enough to run the group here.  Stinsen provided the most insightful comment on Anjams performance:   Technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract  from his overall performance.  On a related topic, Anjam has been taking random days off, typically on short  notice, so I suspect hes interviewing for a new job.  Given his inability to  work with Steven (especially in the future when Stephen heads the group),  this may be the best long-term solution.  Any thoughts?     Ben - Superior:  Another non-controversial ranking.  Ben received  consistently high marks from all the groups he supports, especially in the  area of non-technical skills.  I nominated Ben for promotion to Senior Specialist.  Even though he was  promoted at year end, hes taken on a lot of responsibility training Kirstee  and helping manage the other quant resources in Brians group.  Also, since  Kirstee was hired in at the same level as Ben, a mid-year promotion is  appropriate since hes effectively her supervisor.   Kirstee - Strong:  Only limited feedback in the 2 months shes been here.   High marks for technical/quantitative, strong in the soft skills.  I think  the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a  target for improvement for the rest of the year.   - Dale	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com	enron.com	Dale Surbey dale.surbey@enron.com	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com	2000-06-16T10:02:00+00:00

I am working for Joe Gold and my group is concerned with adding the web as an  additional sales and communication channel for our European business units.  Through the web we are also able to convey a more local image, rather than  presenting ourselves as a Texan company through Enron.com. To set you into perspective about what we have in mind I have attached a  brief presentation which has been the basis for the sign off of the project.    We intend to display a wide training section for the following reasons: document our know-how base educate the market participants generate great stickiness (participants should know that if they need to know  s.th. on energy risk mgt. they should go to Enron) later on: have the option to commercialise this area.

London	<18990703.1075856610829.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey	John,  It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate. I shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time).  Vince         Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe    From:  John Bottomley                           06/19/2000 05:55 AM    To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey  Vince,  John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and  potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which  is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which  discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to  value these options  First, some additional information.  Option characteristics: -- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company) -- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated -- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or  Turkish Lire)  We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75  per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on  December 15, 2000.  The companys investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds)  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due  to such a large valuation gap, they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early  Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.  We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the companys  historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use  (although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)  A few key points: -- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this to  be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation) -- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return -- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount -- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we  obviously do not exercise.  We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach  our difficulty:  since the company doesnt currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing  that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the  non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel  RACs approach is double counting.  If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  Ill give you a  call today or tomorrow after youve had a chance to digest the information.

London	<4931698.1075856610921.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Pricing credit on thousands of names	All -  Our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [5,000 by year-end].  Most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information,  making the challenge harder, and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage. What we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective.  Currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development: FMC Model (default probability approach). Using Bloombergs Fair Market (par  yield) Curves, probabilities are generated from the risky-LIBOR, then  default/bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology. FMC Model (credit spread approach). Using the FMCs, then directly taking the  LIBOR credit spread at each tenor, adjusting for basis and compounding  differences. Bond Model (FMC approach). Taking the FMCs as benchmark curves, the model  regresses the input bonds (specific to a name) on the two best fitting  benchmarks. The result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the FMCs,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer. Prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches. Under testing. Bond Model (spline approach). Taking only the bonds specific to an issuer,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero-coupon price curve,  then builds a zero yield curve from this. Under testing. Market Prices. For certain liquid names, or sectors/ratings, CDS market  prices are used, then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices. KMV. Using Expected Default Frequencies (EDFs) from the KMV model and  database, we will build a model to price default swaps, making appropriate  risk adjustments. KMV is being installed now, so model will be worked on next.  Each of these models returns a price (credit default and bankruptcy), and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and CDS markets, recovery assumptions, risk premia,  capital charges, etc. The aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible, based upon these models, then use these prices, alongside  other financial information, as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system.   Our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers, alongside name-specific soft data from  credit reports and financial statements. If the credit is liquid enough, a  price will be generated from their own information only. Otherwise, the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits, with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights.  The model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market (or trader) prices, and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition. In loose terms, we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices (bonds, equities, default swaps), where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis, financial ratios, etc.  The key steps to implementing such a system will be: Establishing what exactly we want to predict - is it a price, a rating, a  probability, or a score? We will need a clean market history to calibrate to,  which we only really have for ratings. We will then need to develop a mapping  from rating/score to price. Getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model. Building the mechanics of the model, ie, the calibration methodology. Neural  nets/fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates, but which exact methods and  software packages to use? Determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model. Getting the true market price, in order to feed back an error. At present  such a price exists for very few credits. Allocating resources to the development. McKinsey claimed such a system would  take 6-10 man-months to develop.  Further ideas or comments are requested, as we need to develop our strategy  asap. The model description above is fairly vague, as we dont yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details. Further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speed.

Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).  The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst). He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations. He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the oil futures markets.

SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN 2000       06/19/2000   Petroleum Finance Week   (c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc.    Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and  production expenditures by more than they anticipated  at the beginning of the year, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year  update of its annual E&P survey. The 326 companies  we surveyed are planning on an 18.2 percent increase, versus a 10.2 percent  rise budgeted in December, said James D.  Crandell, who follows oil services and drilling for the New York investment  banker.   He emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in Lehmans survey reflects  increases in budgets for 2000 and not  underspending of budgets during 1999. Among the companies that were  included in our December 1999 and May 2000  surveys, global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated  to have been spent during 1999 in December. It  also indicates that nearly $6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide  exploration budgets since December, Crandell said.   The surveys respondents said that they planned to increase U.S. E&P  expenditures by 17.6 percent, up from 15.9 percent  earlier in the year. Crandell said that the greater increase was driven  almost entirely by independent producers. In our survey,  227 independents indicated E&P spending growth in 2000 of 26.1 percent  versus a 22.9 percent increase budgeted for the  year in December, he indicated. Some 40 percent of the independents we  surveyed have increased their U.S. E&P budgets,  while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last  December. Higher natural gas prices and increased  cash flow are the main drivers behind this.   Crandell said that Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: APC), Apache Corp. (NYSE:  APA), BHP Petroleum, H.S. Resources Inc.  (NYSE: HSE), McMoRan Exploration Co. (NYSE: RAN), MDU Resources Group Inc.  (NYSE: MDU), Mitchell Energy and  Development Corp. (NYSE: MND.A and MND.B), Santa Fe Snyder Corp. (NYSE:  SFS), Stone Energy Corp. (NYSE: SGY) and  Titan Exploration Inc. - now Pure Resources Inc. (NYSE: PRS) - were among  the larger independents to make the most  significant upward revisions. The ones that significantly reduced planned  U.S. E&P outlays for the year included Barrett  Resources Corp. (NYSE: BRR), Belco Oil and Gas Corp. (NYSE: BOG), Burlington  Resources Inc. (NYSE: BR), Coastal Corp.  (NYSE: CGP), Forcenergy Inc. (NYSE: FEN), Houston Exploration Co. (NYSE:  HEX), Kerr-McGee Corp. (NYSE: KMG), Mariner  Energy Corp. and Williams Production Co.   The survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage  gain in their 2000 U.S. E&P expenditures (8.8  percent) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year (8.4 percent).  Among the 14 companies in this category, 31  percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 E&P spending estimates  during the first six months, including Amerada Hess  Corp. (NYSE: AHC), Conoco Inc. (NYSE: COC.A and COC.B), Occidental Petroleum  Corp. (NYSE: OXY)and Total Fina Elf S.A.  (NYSE: TOT). Another 19 percent - including ENI SpA (NYSE: E), Royal  Dutch/Shell (NYSE: RDP and STT) and Texaco Inc.  (NYSE: TX) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates, while the  remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey  remained the same.   The increase in Canada... is nothing short of staggering...   The increase in Canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is  nothing short of staggering, Crandell continued. Of  the 85 companies that he contacted, 44.7 percent budgeted higher  expenditures for 2000 than for 1999. Compared with  December, 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000  by more than 10 percent, while 20 percent  have reduced it by more than 10 percent. The remaining 39 percent have kept  it within 10 percent of what was originally  estimated, Crandell said. Talisman Energy Inc. (NYSE: TLM) led the group  with a huge increase, followed by Anderson  Exploration Ltd. (TSE: AXL), Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (NYSE: GOU), Murphy  Oil Corp. (NYSE: MUR), Pan Canadian  Petroleum Ltd. (TSE: PCP) and Shell Canada Ltd. (TSE: SHC). Like their U.S.  counterparts, producers above the border raised  their 2000 E&P budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash  flow, according to the Lehman analyst.   He said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise: The 14.9  percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas  companies that have operations outside the United States and Canada was well  above the 5.7 percent increase for 2000  estimated last December. As in other geographies, there were more companies  that increased budgets than decreased them.  Overall, Crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised  their 2000 E&P budgets by more than 10 percent, 43  estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated  that they would spend less than originally planned.  He said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which  materially increased their budgets, including  Texaco, Petroleos Brasileiros S.A., Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. and Repsol YPF  S.A. (NYSE: REP) among the multinationals and  Amerada Hess, Apache, Premier Oil Plc. and Woodside Energy among mid-sized  companies.   Crandell noted that while respondents average price assumptions rose during  2000s first six months (to $22.04 from $19.25  per barrel of crude oil and to $2.58 from $2.38 per thousand cubic feet of  natural gas), they still trail current prices and what  Lehman Brothers estimates for the year ($28 per barrel of crude and $3.30  per Mcf of gas). This suggests a stronger second  half than expected, should companies raise budgets further to reflect the  higher prices, he said.   - Nick Snow in Washington ---------------------- Forwarded by John Peyton/HOU/ECT on 06/19/2000 07:36  PM ---------------------------   djcustomclips@djinteractive.com on 06/19/2000 08:27:26 PM Please respond to nobody@mail1.djnr.com To: 1346@WCTOPICS.djnr.com cc:   Subject: Energy: Oil Drilling: SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN  ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN ...

We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which  is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which  discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to  value these options  First, some additional information.  Option characteristics: -- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company) -- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated -- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or  Turkish Lire)  We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75  per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on  December 15, 2000.  The companys investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds)  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due  to such a large valuation gap, they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early  Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to swap instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.  We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the companys  historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use  (although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)  A few key points: -- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this to  be negotiated discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation) -- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return -- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount -- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we  obviously do not exercise.  We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach  our difficulty:  since the company doesnt currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing  that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the  non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel  RACs approach is double counting.  If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  Ill give you a  call today or tomorrow after youve had a chance to digest the information.

I would like very much to get together with you and perhaps your investment guy on Friday morning on the 7th if you and/or he have the time or perhaps on the 5th in the afternoon.  I would like to continue the discussions about your using MarketPoint and about your investment guy considering MarketPoint if he is interested.  When you see the progress we have made, I think you will agree that it merits consideration as a part of enrononline.com as well as a profitable investment in its own right.  It is still in the situation where it can be provided exclusively to whomever I choose; I have been very, very careful how I have promoted it so that I do not get committed to a second-rate partner.  I also have what I think is a fundamentally new, general Markovian forward optionality evaluator.  I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation at Stanford in the 1970s (defended with honors) in semi-Markovian decision processes during the heyday of that research, and I have seen direct applications in optionality evaluation.  I think you will be fascinated to see and review it. It is presently implemented in prototype form and it could be made available to the first large retainer client on an exclusive basis who is sufficiently interested.  If you want to be that retainer client, that would be of interest to me.  Give me a shout via return email or by my cell phone at 650.218.3069 regarding schedule.  I am out of town this week but available via email or phone at the above addresses.  I really hope we can get together that week if we possibly can.  Thanks very much for considering my request, and thanks very much for being the go between with your investment guy.  I deeply appreciate it.  I hope to see you on the 5th or 7th.

Techmemos	<17691985.1075856597218.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Option Valuation	John,  I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and  elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being  aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.  Now a few more detailed comments.  1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined  with  a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without  sufficient depth. One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The  approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of  investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized  through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC.   If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent  and use this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that  I recommend this course of action).  2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.  Lets look at it from the position of a seller of the option.  He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the  floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as  opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes  fuzzy. The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on  two factors:  1. risk preference 2. existing portfolio positions  Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that  consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2  standard deviations. The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability  to absorb the loss. I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We  looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more  about it.  Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease  the risk of the overall portfolio. I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not  look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region).  What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the  utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.   If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value). If we dont price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk  premium.  In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot  hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of  the option. How big is the discount? See the comments above.   In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton  paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form  the point of view of  a seller and a buyer will converge.  3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?  We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will  recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world). If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of  NPV as of today. Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases  we are still holding it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is  equivalent to using a  discount rate with a risk premium.  I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a  delay in responding to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we  all agree. Its a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not  have good answers.

The list looks fine and it can be easily expanded, if the first set of articles is well received. I shall prepare a list of topics that occupy us every day and that we could write about without revealing the details of our proprietary research.  Please, feel free to send the message from Lacima. I think that its better for us to sign the articles with our names, giving our respective affiliations. In this way, Enron gets the credit, but not the liability if there is any error in an article.

Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest privately owned manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its finances, so the best I could do is refer to Forbes estimate of $15 Billion annual revenue and to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the business of manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R)) food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other products.  Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that emphasizes the long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win solutions with its suppliers, customers and partners.  As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of researching those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand (people eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).  CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very successful, with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in these arenas. CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports  the purchasing function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a multidiscipline and multinational team with a lot to offer.  Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based on manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this area. Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to talk to.  In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to anything at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to pursue the opportunity we discussed in the future.  I am looking forward to our video conference call.  Kind regards,  Avi    --------------------------------------- Avi I.

I dont want to be a bother to you.  I know you are doing your best to put this together as a go between.  As you might suspect, I am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at Enron because MarketPoint is just now being completed--U.S. and world oil and gas and North American electricity.  We have just signed up our first web provider (e-Acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North American electric generation data base over their website.  I believe we are an integral part of their offering.  It wont be long before MarketPoint needs the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and quickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend or offer fundamental forward projections from our models.  I a loath to do so without the capitalization and staffing we need.  Also, I am loath to do so without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantly available.  I also would be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue the discussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly. I plan to be there the last week in June.

This resulted in disruption  to the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of  ENA servers.  As a cautionary move, Enron OnLine was interrupted while the extent of the  failure was assessed, resulting in the system being unavailable from 11:23 to  11:39.

Other companies analysts say are saddled with hedges include El Paso Energy  Corp. and Coastal Corp., which are merging.   A Coastal official declined to comment on the companys forward positions.   Although El Paso is known for its pipeline business, it produces gas as  result of its $6.2 billion acquisition last year of Sonat. More than 90  percent of that gas is hedged through the rest of the year, said Bruce  Connery, vice president of investor relations. The forward contracts are for  $2.40, he said.   Hedging in the current market plays to the companys primary aim of meeting  investors expectations, Connery said.   Our first goal is to deliver the earnings goal that we set out, and that  dictates that we hedge out commodity volatility, he said.    ...  $2.40??? Are you kidding????

London	<26167347.1075856610763.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	MG Metals: Additional Areas to Look at	Dear Lloyd & Richard,  I have been discussing with Eric Gadd about two particular areas of concern  that will affect the London Research Group.  I believe there are a number of  issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk  management and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a  (by no means exhaustive) list:-  i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic  options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option  pricing add-ins) ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we  can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data  for this).  I am sure Bjorn will be looking to the Research Group to assist  in this matter. iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our  methods and systems and vice versa  These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with  relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the  process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative  research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes  smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to  involve me.

Techmemos	<11108445.1075856597038.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Interesting Article about Enron in Japans Electricity Newspaper	Japans Electricity Newspaper (Denki Shimbun, the equivalent of Megawatt  Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several  of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran  across one on Enron that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I  thought you would find it interesting.  The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by  being first to meet our clients changing needs.  It also describes how we  use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.   The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.  The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is  about Enron.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese  are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.  Denki Shimbun also has a web site at www.shimbun.denki.or.jp.  They have  small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is  completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is  www.criepi.denken.or.jp, the English home site of Japans Central Research  Institute of Electric Power Industry (Denryoku Chuo Kenkyuujou).  The site  has many links to other English-language sites related to the power industry  in Japan.

Stanford	<20696817.1075856631416.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Enron/Stanford Program	Hello Vince, Stinson,  Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very informative.  As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program in place and rolling, and start the students working on it. It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.  If I may, Id like to visit Enron again, sometime in August, to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize the problems to look at. Im in frequent contact with Giuseppe, who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest to Enron.  The plan is this:  1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem space.  2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of good problems of: a) high practical importance b) high innovation potential c) serious scope.  3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to: a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact c) make sure were on the same page regarding research strategy and execution path.  I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his doctoral work in this area.  Im all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these research issues!  Talk to you soon.

Techmemos	<30716107.1075856596967.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Vol rollup	John,  We can approach this problem this way.  Basically you are asking how the total variance (66%)2*143 are distributed among 113 days and the last?30 days.   Assuming volatility for the first period is simga1 and that in the ?last 30 ?days is sigma2, then??(66%)2*143=sigma12*113+sigma22*30  Futhermore, we can use Nov-00 implied volatility as a proxy to sigma1, then  we can calculate sigma2 which is the volatility for Dec-00 contract in the last 30  days.  sigam2=sqrt((66%)2*143-sigma12*113)/30.

Techmemos	<23593945.1075856596945.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: short-sell vs exercise	Chonawee,  As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).  Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option. You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to  $100.   You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise  gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes on your option income (its treated as ordinary income). The tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.   Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option  position as an offset.  The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have  income in the future (or capital gains).  Not so good.  By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem.  Vince       Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON 07/10/2000 11:40 AM To: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: short-sell vs exercise  Below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It  explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised  but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call  option before its maturity). However, after taking Vinces comments on the  ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good  article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-) -chonawee   Short-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options  In general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when  you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In  fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never  reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or  until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold  on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your  exercise.  However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of  exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that  amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up,  you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On  the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the  options to cover your short position anytime.   Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends,  and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as  follow   If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70,  you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no  matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover  the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of  short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can  cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your  options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still  keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the  only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your  short position.

London	<11127225.1075856610587.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Steve Leppard	Dale,  My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London. We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate  this process. Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around  him any longer.  I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase. I would like to offer him a significant increase that goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility. A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.  We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in  practically every location where we operate.  A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false  security for both an employee and the company.  I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc  you. I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.  Vince       Dale Surbey 07/11/2000 10:23 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Steve Leppard  Hi Vince,  HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a  noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to  pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with  a potential gap - particularly in light of what were seeing in our quant  recruiting effort for credit trading and research.  Id like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and  keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:  1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  Im not  sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token  salary increase.  2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for  making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to  EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy  and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at  year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater  responsibility.  3)  We have some people that were trying to get under long-term (3-yr)  contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of  these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.   Weve not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer  to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually  binding him to the job.

London	<23335237.1075856610562.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Sharad Update	Hi Kate,  Firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him.  Sharad  seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected.  He asked me  some questions about the bonus culture at Enron and suggested that it was  not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with.  I sold him  on the value he can extract from the excellence within the Research Group and  the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in, but he  still seemed reticent saying that he needs time which I understood to mean  that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere.  He is a great candidate  and it would be a real shame to lose him, given the difficulty of getting  good candidates.  I discussed this with Vince and given how much we need him in Research in  London and Vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarantee  or sign on to help him make the right decision.  I think Vince will call you or Dale to discuss this.  Regards,  Anjam  Tel: 713 345 9991  [P.S.

Projects	<31028292.1075856593535.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Credit Support Value for MG and PaperCo	Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of  credit support for MG and PaperCo.  My approach is as follows:  1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps. 2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors. 3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the  default option)  using Blacks formula. 4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is  treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back  this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced  rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two  NPVs.  Please give your comments, especially if this makes no sense to you.

Originally we said 10:00 your  time but I guess that the MG meeting will take longer than half an hour. Are  you free around 10:30  your time ?  I think some of the communication problems I originally had with Anjam have  been resolved (although it was a difficult situation to interpret) however, I  would very much like to discuss the situation that I am in concerning my  immediate management.  I have felt that over the last month I have been floundering a little and  have not really been able to turn to anyone in London for direction  concerning VaR (although as expected Steve has been very helpful to give me  an idea on how to proceed theoretically). I do have many of my own ideas  although I think I need to obtain some kind of authority to start any  substantial work. At the moment I feel like I am doing a lot of small things  and am worried that at some stage someone is going to ask the question -  What exactly does she do over there in Research ???  I have talked to Rodrigo  Lamas (RAC model validation new hire) and he has  helped me to focus on some points I had already made.  As a quick summary I have drawn up a memo which outlines some of the points I  think need to be addressed as far as the VaR model is concerned (I could do a  similar memo for the Credit Reserve model but to start have focused my  comments on Market Risk). It is a bit rough and ready (pls excuse any appalling spelling mistakes!) but  I think it will help you to see what I have been thinking about since I have  been here.    I do think that the most important issue is that concerning the origin of the  vol/price curves and how they are constructed.

I hope you had a good holiday - we were all very jealous of you at dinner the other evening.  I made some changes for it to fit in with our notation, etc, but apart from that its a fin piece of work. If you could just answer the questions posed by Vince, and send me the final figure then we are a go (all of ours are now finished). Would you be happy with the following?  3.5 Summary  In this chapter we have discussed volatility modelling and estimation in the energy commodity markets, emphasising the difference between this market and financial markets.  We discuss the estimation of volatility from both historical and implied data, again from the perspective of the energy user. We further discussed a number of stochastic volatility models and have shown how to estimate the models via ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood.  We have tested our estimation techniques on a number of examples drawn from energy markets including electricity, gas and crude oil.  Best regards.

London	<24048814.1075856610427.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	London Research Group	John,  I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.  As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research  Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  its time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjams departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, dont think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.

Then we can apply the European digital option formula.   Attached please find  the c-code I did for  Asian spread option, when I find the effective vol and drift for both  averages then find the option value by calling the European spread option.  You can do just the same for  the Asian digital option.  It would be nice to do a Monte-Carlo, just checking the accuracy of the  approximation.  It was nice to have you here, we are impressed by the work you have done. Keep up the good work.

As I  understand, the payoff to the customer is a fixed cash amount that wil be  paid if the average of the closing prices of aluminium for a month are  greater than the strike agreed in advance, where holiday days do not  contribute to the average.  Russell mentioned that this would be a set of 12 monthly options starting in  Jan-01, and that the LME price for Jan-01 of $1572.5 (which is the future  converging to the spot price on the 3rd Wednesday in Jan 01) can be used as a  proxy/estimate for the average for the month.  Do you have a model for asian digitals or should I proceed with Monte Carlo  to price this, maybe using European digital option model as control variate?

Thoughts?  - Dale      John Sherriff 27/07/2000 06:44 To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard  Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe  Gold/LON/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: London Research Group         Vince - I agree with your conclusion here.  We are still trying to fill  Dales structuring role as well so part of the question is  how we announce Steves lead research role relative to when we know who will  take Dales spot.  Perhaps we should just move forward with the Steve announcement the day that Dale moves full time to  EBS.  I will ask Richard Lewis to take the lead in working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes  to the organization.  But I do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have Steve here.  He is a  wonderfull asset to our efforts.  Thanks!  John     Vince J Kaminski 26/07/2000 22:18 To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Dale Surbey/LON/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard  Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: London Research Group  John,  I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.  As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research  Group, is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  its time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjams departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, dont think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.

Projects	<4458880.1075856593245.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Enron and The New Economy Value Research Lab	Gentlemen:  Enron is exploring the possibility of becoming involved in a research  endeavor called the New Economy Value Research Lab. The Lab is the result of  a joint effort between MITs Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen  (AA). Its purpose is to develop quantitative valuations of the intangible  assets Wall Street finds increasingly important in the New Economy (Business  Week, 2/7/00). Clearly, as Enron continues to shift from a hard asset to  intangible asset based organization, the question of how to accurately and  appropriate measure and value our intangible assets is becoming increasingly  important.  Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and myself met with a  team from AA, the Deputy Dean of the Sloan School, and MITs lead  accounting/finance professor to discuss the intent of the Lab, expected  outcomes, and how Enron may be involved. Post that meeting, the decision was  made to continue to explore participation in the Lab. Enron now needs to 1)  define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs, and 2) identify  value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate.  Once defined, a follow up meeting will be held with MIT and next steps will  be determined.  Your expertise and assistance could significantly impact the inputs and  outcomes of these next steps. Please schedule time on Tuesday August 1 from   2:00 to 3:30 to attend the next meeting, during which we will begin to  identify needs and define value attributes. Location will be EB 49c4. Please  notify me if you are unable to attend.  Lastly, to assist with preparation for this meeting, I am attaching notes  from a recently published book entitled  Cracking the Value Code: How  Businesses Are Creating Wealth in the New Economy (May 2000, Boulton, Libert,  Samek - Arthur Andersen).    Should you like more information on the Lab, previous meeting, book or other,  please feel free to contact me.  I look forward to meeting you.

Australia	<22232469.1075856566564.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	SDDP Model	John, Attached is a copy of the SDDP Methodology manual, written by the  developers.  The model was developed by Mario Pereira, who is the proprietor  of PSRI (Power Systems Research Inc) in Rio de Janeiro.   Their web site is:  www.psr-inc.com where you can find more information about the company and  contact details.  Mario and most of the staff speak English, so phone calls  are possible.    Development of SDDP was originally done on a World Bank contract to compare  the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in  Central America.  It has since found much wider application.  The code runs  on a PC, and is licensed to a number of consultants, power companies, etc.   While I was with ECNZ in Wellington, New Zealand, we purchased a copy around  1994.  The model works with weekly or monthly time steps, with a time horizon of  from 1 to 10 years, for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power  systems.  It represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks,  so it is not a chronological model.  This type of model can not handle  thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints.  Im  not sure how important that would be to you.  The optimization phase of the  model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic  dynamic programming with sampling.  This phase sets up a function for water  value in each large reservoir in the system.  The simulation phase uses a  number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would  operate.  The water values can be used with the short term optimization mode  of SDDP or in some other more detailed short term optimization model.  Most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled.  Many transmission  constraints can be modelled.  A DC load flow option can be used to determine  bus nodal prices.  A Visual Basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files.  If youd like to know more about SDDP, you could call me here in Houston.

Australia	<18933712.1075856566447.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Preface for book	Vince, ? Hope you are well. ? We spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and =  you kindly offered that you would provide this.? Is this still  possible?? = We realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les went  ahead and wrote=  something, which is below, and if you want to review, change or  re-write?t= he preface, that would be very appreciated.? Let me know  what your thoughts a= re. ? Thanks, Julie (were getting close) ? ?  Preface  ?  ?  ?  One of our main objectives in  writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk=  Management has been to bring  together as many of the various approaches fo= r the pricing and risk management  energy derivatives as possible, to discuss=  in-depth the models, and to show how  they relate to each other.? In this =  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models, price a wid= e  range of energy derivatives, or to build a risk management system which use= s a  consistent modelling framework.? We  believe that for practitioners this=  last point is very important and we continue  to stress in our articles and=  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk  management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using  ad-hoc and inconsiste= nt models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE=  CONSISTENT  MODELS?).? However, it is not  our wish to concentrate on one=  particular model or models, at the exclusion of  the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user  (although it will probab= ly be clear from our discussions the model(s) we  prefer).? We therefore try a= nd give  as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al= l the  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models=  which  best suit their needs.  ?  In order to meet our objectives the  book is divided into 11 chapters.?  In=  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to  mode= l and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the  book= .? In addition to introducing  the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes=  modelling framework we outline  the numerical techniques of trinomial trees=  and Monte Carlo simulation for  derivative pricing, which are used througho= ut the book.  ?  In Chapter 2 we discuss the  analysis of spot energy prices.? As  well as=  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes  that=  can be used to model the prices.?  We look at the well-know process of Geometric Brownian Motion as well as  mean reversion, stochastic volatility=  and jump processes, discussing each and  showing how they can be simulated=  and their parameters estimated.  ?  Chapter 3, written by Vince  Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of Enron Corp., discusses volatility  estimation in energy commodity markets.?=   This chapter builds on the previous one.? It examines in detail the methods= ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different=   pricing models introduced in chapter 2.?  Examples from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to illustrate  the technical and interpretativ= e aspects of calculating volatility.  ?  Chapter 4 examines forward curves  in the energy markets.? Although  such=  curves are well understood and straight-forward in the most financial  markets, the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel= l  defined curves.? In this chapter we  describe forward price bounds for ener= gy prices and the building of forward  curves from market instruments.? We  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward  curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the econometric=  approach, and  deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti= c factors.  ?  Chapter 5 presents an overview of  structures found in the energy derivativ= e markets and discusses their uses.? Examples of products analysed in this =  chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy  swaptions, compound options, Asian options, barrier options, lookba= ck options,  and ladder options.  ?  Chapter 6 investigates single and  multi-factor models of the energy spot=  price and the pricing of some standard  energy derivatives.? Closed form =  solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices  both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the=  models in  this chapter including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model.  ?  Chapter 7 shows how the prices of  path dependent and American style option= s can be evaluated for the models in  Chapter 6.? Simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety  of path dependent options.? In order  to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial  tree scheme is developed.? This tree  is built to be consistent with the observed forward=  curve and can be used to  price exotic as well as standard European and American style options.  ?  Chapter 8 describes a methodology  for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed  forward curve.? The approach results  in a multi-factor model that is able to realistically capture the=  evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves.?  The user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general  form.? Closed-form solutions are  developed for pricing standard European options, and efficie= nt Monte Carlo  schemes are presented for pricing exotic options.?

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk  management of energy derivative positions.? =  In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions =  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem  of managing the risk through time.?  We begin with delta hedging a=  portfolio containing derivatives and look  at extensions to gamma hedging = =01) illustrating the techniques using both spot and  forward curve models.? The=  general  model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi-factor hedging of a  portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed.  ?  Chapter 10 examines the key risk  management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)=  applied to portfolios containing  energy derivative products.?

VinceJKaminski <Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com> cc: Subject:?  Preface for book    Vince,  Hope you are well.  We  spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and?   you kindly offered that you would provide this. Is this still?  possible? We realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les  went? ahead and wrote something, which is below, and if you want to  review, change or? re-write the preface, that would be very  appreciated. Let me know? what your thoughts   are.  Thanks, Julie (were getting  close)    Preface        One of our main  objectives in? writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management  has been to bring? together as many of the various approaches  for  the pricing and risk management? energy derivatives as possible, to  discuss  in-depth the models, and to show how? they relate to each  other. In this? way we hope  to help the reader to analyse the  different models, price a wide? range of  energy derivatives, or to  build a risk management system which uses a? consistent modelling  framework. We? believe that for practitioners this last point is   very important and we continue? to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk? management and giving  arbitrage opportunities  to your competitors by using? ad-hoc and  inconsistent models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS  WHO PROPOSE CONSISTENT? MODELS?). However, it is not? our wish to  concentrate on one particular model or  models, at the exclusion of?  the others because we believe that the choice should  rest with the  user? (although it will probably be clear from our discussions  the model(s) we? prefer). We therefore try and give? as clear  account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all the?  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which? best suit their needs.    In order to meet our  objectives the? book is divided into 11 chapters. ? In chapter 1  we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to?  model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the?  book. In addition to introducing? the techniques that underlie the  Black-Scholes modelling framework we outline? the numerical techniques  of trinomial trees  and Monte Carlo simulation for? derivative pricing,  which are used throughout the book.    In Chapter 2 we discuss  the? analysis of spot energy prices. As? well as analysing  empirical price movements we propose a number of processes? that   can be used to model the prices. ? We look at the well-know process of  Geometric Brownian Motion as well as? mean reversion, stochastic  volatility and jump processes, discussing each and? showing how they  can be simulated and their parameters estimated.    Chapter 3,  written by Vince? Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of   Enron Corp., discusses volatility? estimation in energy commodity  markets. ? This chapter builds on the previous one. It examines in  detail the methods,?  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation  process assuming different? pricing models introduced in chapter 2.  ? Examples from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to  illustrate? the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating  volatility.    Chapter 4 examines forward curves? in the  energy markets. Although? such  curves are well understood and  straight-forward in the most financial? markets, the difficulty of  storage in many energy markets leads to less well? defined  curves. In  this chapter we? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and  the building of forward? curves from market instruments. We?  outline the three  main approaches which have been applied to building  forward? curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the  econometric approach, and? deriving analytical values by modelling  underlying stochastic factors.    Chapter 5 presents an overview  of? structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses  their uses. Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety  of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as  energy swaptions, compound  options, Asian options, barrier options, lookback  options, and ladder  options.    Chapter 6 investigates single and? multi-factor  models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard?  energy derivatives. Closed form? solutions for forward prices, forward  volatilities, and European option prices? both on the spot and  forwards are derived and presented for all the models in? this chapter  including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model.

We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let Rick  obtain  clarification of some issues from AA. I would agree that AA came up with a  rather vague concept of what they want to accomplish.  Vince     To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: MIT/AA Lab- next meeting  Vince: Can you shed any light on this? Im confused (really confused)....  Do you think this means the decision to go ahead/not is going to be made only  by Kean, Buy and Koening? And Do you think this means that we shouldnt meet on Thurs? Personally, I think Enron really needs to meet on Thurs to buckle down and  start developing some idea of needs/wants with regard to the outcomes of the  Lab.  From a practical perspective, if we cant get what we want from this whole  thing, Ricks issue of where AA is going with this is really a mute point,  isnt it? So a working meeting might really be worth the effort.  Would appreciate your insight and advice. Thanks.

Australia	<11158961.1075856566396.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Outage Tracker Option And Background	Karl,  Thanks a lot. I have passed this information to Grant Masson who worked here on a related problem. He will get in touch with you regarding this technology.  Vince      Karl Tomlinson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/24/2000 06:00 PM To: Vince J Kaminski@ECT cc:   Subject: Outage Tracker Option And Background   Vince,  To follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious  plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage.  The system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best  option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along  with relative network performance from a few points.  I am currently chasing NEMMCO (AU system operator) to get hold of a few weeks  of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough  measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas.  The idea follows along the lines (literally !) that when a unit fails it will  introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency, which is then  reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators. The drop  in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may  change the phase shift across the whole grid. The phase shift across the  network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion  devices switching on and off, however a unit failure may be distinct.  The second option relates to how a unit fails, whereby if a circuit breaker  is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns, then the outage will  cause an RF pulse that should propogate across some of the network.  Transformers will attenuate the pulse, however it should be detectable many  miles away from the fault location. Measure the arrival time at several point  on the network, work out the shift and backtrack on the network. Part of the  solution is already proven in lightning trackers. The solution may be made  more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed  (i.e. measuring the three phases at 1MHz and then sending the data through a  DSP). This solution is more complex, however this should allow unit failure  to be pinpointed to a station. The timing base for each of the nodes may be  sourced from GPS timing, self locating at the same time !  Will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups.   Karl.

We shall give him an offer of a job in Houston (on the terms we discussed with)  plus an option to stay in London, if he does not like Houston.  His choice.

I told them that the deal you and I communicated to Anjam was firm  and not negotiable (with the exception of the issues regarding the flat  rental).  Apparently, Anjam is trying to play hard ball.  Whats your  commitment to Anjam?  Should we explore a package deal? My vote is no.  Grant.     Tara Rozen 08/09/2000 12:17 PM To: Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Melanie Doyle/LON/ECT@ECT  Subject: Houston Research Opportunity  Grant  Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to convince Anjam that he  should transfer on a local US package. The difficulty is not so much the  compensation and benefits, it seems more to do with the actual job and  long-term prospects. He will only, therefore, commit to 12 months and only on  assignment terms.   We explained to Anjam the rationales for transferring locally, ie not just  cost but equitability among his peers. He is convinced that his skills and  Enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a  local deal. Also, he was apparently told by Vince that it was impossible for  you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market  rate.   Would you like to move further with this? If so, we can put together costs  for you for a 12 month assignment and see what you think. I am out tomorrow  but back in on Friday and could do it for you then.  Let us know!

I felt that it would be useful to  bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.  I met Melanie this  morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in  Houston.  I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine  from a career progression perspective and Houston Researchs to fill an  urgent need.  Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has  kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of  the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.  I  expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign  assignment representative in the near future.  I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to  make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make  the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working  with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in  terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.   The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron  Corp is too dramatic and requires me to burn bridges and my return to Enron  Europe would be difficult.  Also, I would lose the valuable support  structures available to me in London.  The amount of any fixed costs  (flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely  reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they  justify making the contract a three year (local) one.  I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience &  value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have  identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an  Excellent rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also  Excellent), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my  existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off  allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).

Given our growing workload and responsibilities, the quality of the paper is  less than satisfactory. I would like to make sure that there are no obvious and embarrassing  errors in what we submit. I would appreciate if you could  take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback (under the same arrangement as in the previous cases).  Thanks for looking at our storage model.

London	<7655035.1075856610246.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Houston Research Opportunity: Anjam	Vince:  Here is an explanation of what a 12 month package for Anjam actually entails. It seems to me that Anjams interest in getting an expat package is mostly  about money.   Based on the UK HRs read of Anjam, they think he will jump.   I have a telephone conference with Anjam at 11:00.  My stance will be 110 is  firm. We will help with the transition via a one time settlement:  flat  rental issues, 500lbs of air shipping for moving furniture, maybe one trip  back to UK a year, but no more.  Re: his concerns of having a place in London  should he want to return, I will say that Vince would be far better at  finding a good spot for you than any HR type, so that part of the package  promise is not particularly important.   Any guidelines for me to follow, coach?  Regards, Grant. ---------------------- Forwarded by Grant Masson/HOU/ECT on 08/11/2000 08:44  AM ---------------------------   Tara Rozen 08/11/2000 05:44 AM To: Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Melanie Doyle/LON/ECT@ECT, Jane Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Re: Houston Research Opportunity    Grant  Not sure if I told you that I work Mon, Wed, Friday hence the delay in  responding. Sorry if I forgot to tell you! Another contact name in my absence  who will be able to assist is Jane Allen in Houston (cced above).  Three main reasons we try to stay away from assignments to the US for this  type/level of transfer are: 1)cost 2)equitability among other peers  3)difficulty in transferring employee to local package from assignment  package. However, if this is truly a 12 month assignment with no intention of  extension, we would normally do the following:  12 month assignment London base, car allowance,  and benefits and National Insurance contribution  costs (currently 12.2% of all comp compared with 1.45% of all comp plus 6.2%  up to max of $76K of employers US contribution) Housing costs in Houston paid if maintaining housing in the UK (usually up to  $1800 per month for single) Utility costs if maintaining a house in the UK - up to $100 per month Home Leave - two economy trips per year is standard Transportation to/from assignment - economy class Transportation in Houston - we normally give this - up to $40 per day for  rental car in addition to the persons car allowance as they normally do not  require a car in the UK and take the car allowance as a cash benefit whereas  they will require a car  in Houston. Shipment of goods  - 500lbs air Tax Assistance  Disturbance allowance - normally pay approx $1000   So, in terms of costs if you just compare a local US salary of Manager on  $100K to a local UK Manager on o68K the US total cost is approx $120K. The UK  cost is approx $230K. Then if you add the above costs to the assignment, you  will see an even greater increase in cost compared with the local peers, ie  approx $280K compared with $120K. We do have the ability to change the above  in any way as there is no set policy; however, Anjam has already brought up  other peoples assignments and I have a feeling he will do his best to find  out what everyone else is receiving. If we make clear, though, that we are  keeping on UK payroll but not providing any assignment type allowances just  in order for him to maintain his pension contributions for the year and at  which point a decision will need to be made (returns or moves to local US),  then we may be able keep more consistency with your group while maintaining  more reasonable costs. Not sure how you want to play this, though.  Even if he does go on assignment rather than transfer locally, there is still  the issue of whether or not a suitable job will be here at the end of the 12  months. We will always do our best to find suitable postions but we cannot  guarantee it. If he transfers to a local US contract, Enron Europes  responsibility of finding suitable employment is pretty much nil.  I hope this has made things clearer rather than more complicated. I honestly  feel that Ajnam will absolutely not take this position if it is not on an  assignment basis. He made it pretty clear that unless he could stay on UK  payroll for 12 months, he would not transfer.  Call me if you would like to discuss.

The attached zipped file contains the second half of the chapter for which I  was responsible.  Vince will send you his half separately.  Putting them  together should be a simple matter of cut and paste, assuming that Vince has  not changed his equation, figure, or table numbering.    I presume Chris will be reading through the chapter once again for editorial  reasons. There is one place where I would ask him for specific redaction:   Table 3.6 Model specifications on page 14/15 has a column labeled Equation  Reference.  Some cells are blank because the equations specified have not  been referenced previously in the parts I have written.  Nevertheless, the  concepts are surely introduced elsewhere in the book, and it may be helpful  for Chris to insert the appropriate reference in this table.  Alternatively,  one could simply delete the column.   If I can help in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Australia	<10091468.1075856566147.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Full version	I read the chapter. Generally, I like it, and find it non-controversial and well written. Of course, this is a huge topic and there are things that you havent discussed.  I thought the amount of attention paid to OLS and MLE estimation was a bit overboard, given that you didnt really exploit it in your results. If you were to state the likelihood function for the GARCH model, it might justify the amount of attention to gave to estimation for simple iid processes, which could then be thought of as a simple lead-in and intuition builder to the more interesting models that you do actually use.  By the way, in your discussion of smiles, you discuss fat tails extensively. At least for equity markets, while fat tails contribute, they dont do very much at all compared to the effect of risk premia, which you allude to briefly, using supply-demand language, at the end of that section.  For the impact of risk premia, see Jun Pans paper, which is available from her web page. But she covers only SP500, (as do most studies), and your markets are obviously much different.  The chapter will be a good service to your readers!

I am wondering whether research is looking into the application  of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news  article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min,  etc.   I am in particular referring to the news article below:  http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm  In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for  t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in  particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could  provide a meaningful tool for the analysis.   Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has  a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts  of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich)  is indicating the application of EVT to V@R....   Thank you!

Projects	<25483795.1075856592892.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Long-Term Volatility Curves	Grant,  Can Research in Houston put together a comparison of the long-term volatility  curves for gas and power in North America and Europe?  Based on where Europe  is marked (especially for the UK), I think well find a significant  difference out beyond 10 years.  Fundamentally, it seems like the long-term  vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location.  Has Research done any work on this in the past?  If not, we should study this  since long-term vol feeds into the VAR-based position limits.  Give me a call so we can discuss.

In the meantime we have produced a graph which shows, as indices, market  values of the water companies and the RAB of the industry since  privatisation.  The following points come out 1 Market values overtime have been 1.1x RAB 2 The result is significantly skewed by the period between Mid 1997 and end  1998 when the ratio was c1.5x. 3 The premium to RAB is only found at a time when political uncertainty has  been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal  significantly.  Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in  share prices in the last year  Just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of  water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the RAB market  value ratio is a straight average.

MONTHLY ELECTRICITY PRICES FOR THE PAST 13 MONTHS	Margaret,   Please find attached file with average monthly prices for regions your  requested. This file gives more information than the previous (yesterday)  one. As the one before, source for this file is Megawatt daily, it includes  On-Peak and Off-Peak prices and you can also see daily data that was  converted to monthly average data. There are two types of averages prices:  average and weighted average. Weighted average takes into account number of  transactions of certain price.  For example: PJM had average price of $53.61 and weighted average price of  $53.15 in August , it means that there were more transactions of lower price  than higher.  Also, Megawatt Daily has its own methodology and I am attaching  it with this message.

Cheers, Christian      To: Christian Werner/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:    Subject: Re: extreme value theory applied to weathet    Christian:  To my knowledge, the research group is examining EVT primarily in the context  of Value at Risk calculations.  We have not looked at EVT for power, because,  to date, we have been focussing on shorter term fundamental forecasting of  price excursions: i.e. given tomorrows load forecasts and expected plant  dispatch, we attempt to predict which lines will become constrained and how  the system will react to alleviate these constraints. I would be interested  in your thoughts on how EVT would benefit the traders however.  As far as the  weather goes, I would expect the weather desk to use EVT at some level.   Clearly you should talk to Joe Hrgovcic, the researhc chap attached to the  weather desk, for a more accurate assessment.  Cheers, Grant.

I am wondering whether research is looking into the application  of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news  article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min,  etc.   I am in particular referring to the news article below:  http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm  In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for  t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in  particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could  provide a meaningful tool for the analysis.   Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has  a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts  of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich)  is indicating the application of EVT to V@R....   Thank you!

My agenda includes the review of a number of deals (Wessex, TPL, Eastern,  ...), as well as the  review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their  respective volatility curves. Currently I am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the UK gas market,  its respective price curve and term structure of volatility.

Techmemos	<13835011.1075856596515.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Floating LNG Terminal	Folks,  As a follow-up to Scott Neals inquiry this morning concerning  portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no  such capability currently exists. According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this  opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far  as we know, has constructed such a vessel.    I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the  Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they  have not built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel  would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required  operational and  environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.   Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel, http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm  Please let me know if any further research is needed.

The meetings been very productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more clearly.  We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships  (RA) for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental requirement.  Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September, just before school starts.  I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please, let me know how you would like to proceed.  Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive  collaboration during the coming year and beyond.

Australia	<20669230.1075856566057.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: EPRM article	Chris,  This is very well written and will serve the reader well. A few comments.  1. When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the  classification based on 3 categories:   a. variance/covariance  method                 b. historical simulation                 c. Monte Carlo simulation.  Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument.  2. I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio. The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylors expansion)  that may  involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the  same model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).  The main benefit of using the  MC simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way. I would  emphasize that there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you  the references  from home).  3. I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving quickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices, behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature).  4. For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. This process may be a source of a big error.  5. The computational burden of MC can be reduced through clever preprocessing of a portfolio that introduces no error. Many swaps with the same underlying can be aggregated into one positions ( they are  portfolios of forwards and  they are linear instruments).  Please, feel free to use any comment (or none).

Techmemos	<4577031.1075856596471.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Transport Fuel P/L	---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 08/30/2000 11:06 AM  ---------------------------   Zimin Lu 08/30/2000 11:07 AM To: Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Andrew H Lewis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Couch/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Transport Fuel P/L    Colleen,  After looking into the transport deals for NBPL (long term deal 1,2, 25,26),  I think I figured it out why we see positive fuel P/L for deal 1,25,and 26 and negative fuel P/L for deal  2.   The following plot shows NYMEX curve as of 8/23/00:     For short term, NYMEX moved up compared to that of 8/22/00, while the long  term NYMEX moved down.  Here are the tenor for each deal:  Deal 1:   start 01-Sep-00, end 22-May-09,    the above graph suggested a  positve fuel P/L Deal 2:   start 01-sep-00, end 28-feb-02,       the above graph suggested a  small negative P/L Deal 25: start 01-may-02, end 28-feb-09,      the above graph suggested a  positve fuel P/L Deal 26: start 01-mar-09, end 31-may-09,    the above graph suggested a  positve fuel P/L  The transport book seems to be correct on these fuel P/Ls.   Another point worth to mention is that the fuel cost is related to index  price (NYMEX+basis+index premium), to correctly interpret fuel P/L, we need to look at the index curve change.

Projects	<23030349.1075856592494.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Clean Fuels - GPG business segment	Dwight and I are working to develop an updated valuation for the MTBE and  methanol business segments.  We would appreciate assistance from your group  in assessing the market over the next 3-4 years.    With the octane shortage this summer, and the strong gas and oil price  environment, MTBE prices are well above budgeted levels.  How will  political/environmental issues affect MTBE prices over the next few years.    Methanol prices are also now very favorable, but it would seem that North  American methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in NA remain  higher than the rest of the world.  Your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most  helpful.  Both Dwight and I are available to meet with you or a member of  your group as soon as convenient.

I just want to drop you a line  since we havent talked in a while and give you a progress update.  First, I  feeling much better.  Eventhough I was out last week, I finished the  following curves:    Canadian CPI Phillippines FX and CPI Mexican FX and CPI Saudi Arabian FX and CPI Guatemalan FX  We also helped London RAC with finding information on the UK inflation model  to backtest it.  Gwyn and Yana kept me very busy last week.  Yana, who lives  close by me was nice enough to drop off work at night.  Gywn and I worked on  the curves over the phone.   Yesterday, I got a call from Terry Thorn, he needed economic information and  a presentation to give to EGM management.  I gave him a copy of the  conforming assets presentation, he was very pleased.  This week, Im working  on a urgent request from RAC.  The board has decided to resurrect Dragon 2,  so we are preparing all the curves for the APACHI region.  Im also working  on the metals presentation.  See you Thursday.

For a  variety of legal, contractor, and operational reasons, I need to confirm some  of the following requirements as soon as possible so we can proceed:  a)  You need rainfall, snowfall, and temperature measurement from one,  high-accuracy commercially available weather station. b)  You need a daily feed of this data to Enrons weather desk:  Does this  mean one data dump at a set time per day?  Alternatively, will you need to  check the data real-time, perhaps at varying and multiple times during the  day?  c)  We will be installing this station near Sacramento, California:  We will  need to know exactly what areas in/near Sacramento are suitable for the site  of the weather station.  (What again was the name of the town that you  mentioned Mark?)  In the interest of time, I recommend that your weather  expert accompany our landman to select the site, which will allow our landman  to more quickly lease and install the station. d)  You desire to have some independent security measures to deter or detect  tampering. I suggest given the very short time fuse, that we first install  the station and then develop security measures. e)  We will feed the data directly to the Enron weather desk.  Will any other  parties require real-time access to this data?  Please forward responses directly to:  Chris Clark/NA/ENRON and myself.

London	<14384041.1075856609772.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Indication Dates for Sharads Visit	Hi Vince,  Having discussed with Sharad, we think it would make sense for Sharad to go  to Houston for a few weeks starting at the end of October.  This would  overlap with Bens visit in November and so some alternative arrangement  would have to be made for accommodation.  If he goes after Ben then there  will not be much time before the holidays meaning it would be left until  early next year.  Please let us know if these dates work for you, and if so  then we can talk about accommodation arrangements thereafter.

London	<20976382.1075856609704.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Reporting lines	Vince  Ive just had a chat with Richard, who feels strongly that the natural  synergies between, and independence of, Research and Structuring will be best  served if I report to Tani.  I expressed my concerns that I want to keep a strong link with: 1. accountability to the trader sense of urgency, and 2. traders willingness to spend money where necessary.  Richard suggested that we have a strong dotted line of reporting in to him,  and that he will be available to support these areas.  Well meet regularly  to keep Richard in the loop.  I filled Richard in on the fact that I wish to change the nature, not just  the size, of the Research Group, which will involve significant changes in  headcount and investment in hardware/software.  Ive no doubt that my main concerns of accountability and budget support will  be met whether I report to Richard formally or informally.  Tani has indicated that shed be prepared to have Research report to her if  required.

Projects	<31033517.1075856592316.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Briefing Robert Johnston on Metals	Vince,  Sorry, I was not able to take your call this morning, to avoid distractions I  was editing a technical coner article on PPP out of my office.  Last Friday,  I called Robert Johnston immediately after you told me to contact him to  brief him on nonferrous metals.  I let him know that I was scheduled to speak  about Metals in our research meeting on October 12th.  I also talked with him  a few weeks ago that I would like to meet with him and Scott Tholan to brief  them on metals.   Robert did not arrange the meeting.  I arranged a meeting  for 10:30 tomorrow to take them both through the metals fundametals speech.    The London Metals Confererence sounds great, since I have five years  experience in metals fundamental analysis and pricing, I would also like to  attend.  Many of my new research group customers are asking for my expertise  in this new business for Enron.  I could certainly help our customers better  by getting the latest information on metals.  Please let me know if this is  OK with you.   Regards,    Maureen	Maureen Raymond maureen.raymond@enron.com	enron.com	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com		2000-10-05T12:23:00+00:00

I can see some excellent collection opportunities for our group as a result  of your presentation and look forward to discussing them with you on my  return.  We think we can get excellent info on production & exports in  Russia, as well as good insight into anti-dumping out of DC and the WTO.   Labor unrest, environmental problems, civil unrest are other possibilities.  FYI, the speeches from todays LME seminar will be posted on the LME website  tomorrow.

Added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the  finished surveys should generate more than $26 million per site (based upon  $15/barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner)in  revenue.  By re-selling this data to market analysts or by internally using  this data for forecasting future oil/gas production Enron could increase the  accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally.

I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of  the (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data  driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of  broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.    I asked Adler or Reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.   Have they contacted you yet?  2) Im converting to consultant - Ive had a great year here but need to get  back north more often (family).

The unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position  is being associated with specific prices.  These prices are the effective buy  or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position.    Stated differently, the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price  variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gammas  standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs.  This is something I dont  understand.  To date, inquiries to the risk management accounting group has  further revealed that the gamma component of P&L is not well understood.    This is what concerns me: Bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures (NYMEX  and Gas Daily).  Both books dynamically hedged its positions during  yesterdays large price move and, through anticipitory hedging in advance or  during the large price move, secured sufficient coverage to neutralize  expected changes in delta.  However, our P&L from our underlying position did  not offset our gamma P&L.  Consequently, I have to ask WHY?  Im hoping that a  brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which  will better guide our hedging decisions.

The comment about hedgeing JCC with Brent is right  on if the exercise is to hedge our own LNG positions that we have tieds to  JCC. Note that the high JCC correlation to Prompt Brent is not something that  is obvious to non-Enron LNG-tied-to-JCC buyers. If you are an LNG-tied-to-JCC  buyer, and you wish to hedge your purchases, wouldnt you want to be able to  transact ona a JCC contract? My objective is to have a JCC contract on EOL,  whereby we, Enron, take the JCC/Brent risk (which is why we asked Vince  Kaminskis group to study the relationship and give us a hedge ratio to use).  Im attaching a model used to calculate JCC for Dabhol Power Co.s Adgas and  Oman LNG contracts. Basically what happens is that all the raw oil volumes  imported into Japan and added up and the total price is divide by the total  volume, and there is a Yen/US$ foreighn exchange component as well. That is  JCC. It was designed by the Japanese so that they could tie their LNG imports  to their average price of crude imports whereby the LNG would be cheaper on  an MMBTU basis.  Comments?

Can we set up a  contract on EOL, using the Prompt Brent-JCC hedge ratio, to hedge JCC?

Australia	<31736818.1075856565895.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Comments	Julie,  Sorry for the delay. Here are he comments.  Vince  ************************************  Sorry for long delay in responding. I have a few comments. Most are focused on the third article as here is till time to make modifications.  1.  In the second article, I would mention that the formulation of the mean reversion process represents one of several possible equations that capture the same type of market evolution of prices over time. 2.  One comment that applies to both articles. The problem is how one defines the time series of energy prices. The numbers used for Australian NSW pool prices seem to correspond to chronological prices. One alternative approach is to build different time series for the corresponding time intervals for each day. This would result in different price behavior and estimates of jump. The choice is one of convenience and depends on actual problem under investigation. One could argue that volumes of electricity traded during different time slots represent different economic commodities. Figure 3a (Jump Frequency) has units on the vertical axis that require explanation. Are we talking about an expected number of jumps in the total number of half hourly periods in a year?

Deal with seismic company was done by a Mark Peterson who is still with  Enron.  I havent caught up with him for details but it had to do with  underwriting (risk of no sales) seismic survey.  Timing is important.   Interest may have picked up in new surveys and the survey company decided  that they didnt need Enron anymore because they no longer saw a risk of no  sales.    2. 3-D surveys will happen where there is an abundance of E & P activity or  be spurred on by successes in a given basin.  While activity continues in the  Gulf of Mexico on the shelf, the major discoveries are being found in the  deep water.  Worldwide, the shallow water plays have been looked at and  worked for years - they were accessible with the extraction technology of the  time.  I dont think that deep water sedimentation /depositional systems were  completely understood to even begin to try to justify looking in deep water.   Concepts have evolved quite quickly.  The point is that many deep water  accumulations are incredibly large - billion barrel accumulations.  These  sizes are like those accumulations that were found decades ago when companies  were drilling surface structures.  The large reserves are needed to pay for  the corresponding incredibly expensive costs of deepwater field development.   I believe that finding and development costs ($/barrel) are at least two to  three times shelf f & d costs in the Gulf of Mexico.  This differential is  probably large with international projects (and that doesnt take into  account political risk).   Ill look forward to more involvement if and when this project /concept goes  forward.  Feel free to forward this to all participants.

Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not  continued to do this, etc.  Also, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3-D surveys are in deep  water.  I read recently that Shell, I believe, is participating in a deep sea  drilling/extraction project in the Gulf.  What oil price is required to make  these kinds of projects viable financially?

The total annual revenue generated by these  assets is no less than $20B and could be substantially higher as the  estimated capacity on some of these facilties is likely understated and other  facilties not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.  Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial  complexes from Houston northward and eastward as they are much less likely to  experience such a drought-induced interruption.  The only facilties  identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado,  Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments as we work to determine  whether or not a low riverflow insurance product is viable.

Techmemos	<33051169.1075856596330.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Option Pricing Challenge	Zimin,   to generalize your initial comment, for any process dS = Mu(S,t)*S*dt +  Sigma(S,t)*S*dz, the delta-hedging argument leads to the Black-Scholes PDE.   This is true for any arbitrary functions Mu and Sigma, and so includes GBM,  Mean Reversion, and others. There is no problem with this, because in the risk-neutral world, which is  what you enter if you can hedge, the drift of the actual process is irrelevant.  I believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price  for Mean Reversion process.  This can only happen if the asset is not  hedgeable, and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the  option pricing.   If you assume that the underlying is a non-traded factor,  then the PDE will have to reflect the market price of risk, and the drift of  the actual process is then reflected in the PDE.  Vasant      Zimin Lu 10/17/2000 05:20 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant  Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pinnamaneni Krishnarao/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alex  Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kevin Kindall/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tanya  Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Option Pricing Challenge   Dear All,  I have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95.    Hope you can give  me a convincing answer .  Zimin  ---------------------------------  In deriving BS differential equation, we assume the underlying follows GBM  ds= mu*s*dt + sigma*s*dz  where mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, both can be a function of s.  Then we use delta hedging argument, we obtain the BS differential equation  for the option price, regardless of mu.    With the BS PDE and boundary condition, we can derive BS formula.  Fine. No  problem.  Question comes here.   Suppose the underlying is traded security and follows,  say, mean-reverting process  ds=beta(alpha-s)dt + sigma*s*dz  Apparantly, this SDE leads to a different probability distribution. However,  using the delta hedging argument, we still get the same BS differential equation, with the same boumdary  condition, we get the same BS formula.   Not fair !  From another angle, I can derive the distribution from the BS PDE for the  underlying, which is the lognormal distribution. My thinking is: can I drive the distribution for any SDE from the option PDE  ?  The answer should be yes, but got to be from a different PDE rather than BS PDE.  Then what we do about the  delta-hedging argument ?  Thanks.

Projects	<24867081.1075856591756.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	enrons new weather system, courtesy the research dept.	V  Last night, I tested our new system for real-time surveillance and messaging  of the weather, and it delivers the data to desktops throughout the building  more than 6 1/2 minutes before the National Weather Service updates their  webpages. Our current technology was web-scraping these pages via ftp, then  parsing into a database. The impact of these 6 1/2 minutes for the hourly  power traders is enormous- the weather stations upload their data around 53  minutes after the hour, and we can now receive them within 2 minutes later.  We can now re-estimate our nonlinear stack model before the top of the hour,  when hourly power trading begins. Otherwise, we would not have model results  until around 15 minutes after the hour. Notably, hourly power trading is, for  all intents and purposes, concluded by then (they trade for 10-15 minutes and  manage the scheduling for the next 30 or so miutes). So, effectively, we may  now be one *hour* ahead of where we were just a few days ago, in terms of  information. People are very excited up here, from the CTO on down- thanks  for letting it happen.

London	<11028315.1075856609424.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Exotica (yet again)	Hi guys  I need some advice.  Sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions  of Exotica.  At some point we will need to migrate London office over to your  more up-to-date version, and Im concerned that there may be RAC-style  implications.  Im in favour of using the IT testers to carry out formal  regression testing, and they are apparently able to do this.  Do we need to get our heads together to form a view before we involve RAC  or the business groups?  Anjam tells Sharad that London Exotica was built using Excel 95, and that  neither he nor Zimin knows how to build/compile the XLA using later versions  of Excel.  Is this true?  If so, then we need to migrate to XLLs sooner  rather than later because of the maintenance implications.

Techmemos	<7281044.1075856596307.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	transport model	Andy,  The scale effect in the transport model can be explained.   I use a European option to do the illustration.  I raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount, use the fuel  percentage to adjust the strike. The net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up.  If the fuel percentage is not very high, the option premium actually  increases with the level, although the intrinsic value decreases.    If the fuel percentage is very high (>8%), then we see a decreasing option  price.  In the transport deal, fuel change is often below 5%, so you will not see a  decreasing spread option price when NYMEX moves up.  So I think the transport model still does what it  should do.   Zimin   In the following exmaple, I used r=6%, vol%, T=100days, see spreadsheet  for details.                ---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 10/20/2000 01:24 PM  ---------------------------   Zimin Lu 10/20/2000 10:45 AM To: Andrew H Lewis/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Colleen Sullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: level effect in transport    Andy,  The following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport  valuation.  I add an NYMEX add-on to both delivery and receipt price curve before fuel adjustment, keep everything else the same.

London	<4443625.1075856609380.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	In Confidence/Project Status	Hi Vince  Id originally been told you wouldnt be back until Wednesday, and so have  another meeting booked for 4:30pm (London time) today.  I really need to  speak with you about the situation here in London re Anjam.  To be blunt,  Sharad, Kirstee and I have all been tempted to just walk out of the office  until Anjam is removed.  The major problems are: 1. I have no authority to demand Anjam should cooperate with Sharad, Kirstee  etc. on their work.  He does his best to impede their work, and I have no  ability to access his drives for data/spreadsheets. 2. Anjam removes me from the cc lists in reply to all emails received by him,  in an attempt to remove me from the loop. 3. Anjam continues to do business, and people in London still think hes  head of Research. 4. Pending your announcement, people will continue to go to Anjam, and the  business will remain dependent on him. 5. Were severely under-resourced.  Im still awaiting your review of the  email I drafted for John S, requesting additional resource.  I cant make a  big recruitment drive until I have the authority to hire more. I honestly feel I cant do my job, and Im currently asking myself what Im  even doing here.  Notwithstanding the above, here is the current picture with our projects:  Steve 1. Initiated new pre-trade system for oil trading desk.  Hooked up relevant  IT resource with business people, keeping an overall eye on making sure the  business reqts get translated into IT-speak. 2. Enron Direct demand forecasting system review. 3. Initiated global supply/demand database with coal group. 4. Constant firefighting across all desks.  Ben 1. Work on regression-based placement model. 2. General review of EnronCredit.coms quant models.  Matthew 1. Ongoing work with EnGOAL. 2. Produced first prototype of gas capacity charge optimisation tool for  Continental Gas desk.  Need to purchase local copy of CPLEX.  Kirstee 1. Diverted from Richard Lewiss request for the UK gas/power vol curves to  be sorted out, onto Eastern Virtual Power Station restructuring project.   Involves extension runs of credit reserve model, and now it seems the model  needs to be extended. 2. Constant VaR firefighting.  Slava 1. Finished all regressions and model identification for UK gas and power  demand forecasting.  We are now ready to start IT implementation. 2. Enron Direct demand forecasting system review.  Sharad 1. Exotica support/firefighting, made nearly impossible by Anjam. 2. Option on strip of metals futures for Enron Metal.  I do hope we get a chance to speak and resolve some of these issues.  Im  really not happy at present.  Best regards, Steve	Steven Leppard steven.leppard@enron.com	enron.com	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com		2000-10-24T16:22:00+00:00
London	<31743911.1075856609358.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Inflation Model Review - Final Version	This morning a draft of RACs Inflation Model Review was discussed with Anjam.  All points as presented in the draft were agreed upon.  Also, four new points were amended as suggested by Anjam:  The RPI short-term model could be improved by a combination of the  information available from the GILTS and RPI Swaps market. Add:  This is an issue across all Enrons econometric models. to section  PLLU and DZCV Short-term, First Point. To implement some of the suggestions requires additional statistical and  programming resources. Additionnal human resources with advanced econometric modelling skills are  required given the current workload of the european research team.  Please find the final version attached.  Please note that the short term solution has been to freeze the curve.  The medium to long term solution involves futher research towards a sounder  and more efficient model. Given the current workload of the European Research Group, it is necessary to  hire a new member of staff with strong economics and econometrics background  to address this issue properly.  RAC will communicate to the Financial Trading Group and Risk Management the  actions to take as the curve will be frozen.

One more person will take a look at it.  Vince  ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 10/25/2000  03:13 PM ---------------------------   Stinson Gibner 10/25/2000 01:16 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kevin Kindall/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Subject: Matthew Patteson, Inventor  Vince,  After reviewing the documents furnished by Mr. Patteson,  I do not feel that  Enron should consider engaging in any testing, development, or licensing of  his proposed generator for the following reasons:  1.  Enron is not currently in the business of developing or manufacturing  electrical generation equipment and does not plan, as far as I know, to enter  this business.   The one exception is our ownership in entities developing  wind and solar, renewable energy.  2.  Enron does not have the proper facilities or expertise to test or develop  Mr. Pattesons proposed generator.  3.  There could be substantial risk in testing this generator as it would  involve boiling of a flammable material under pressure.  4.  I do not believe that the proposed generator will produce any significant  quantity of electrical power.   The generator produces power by induction.   That is, electric current is induced by a changing magnetic field.   The  mechanism powering the changing magnetic field is the movement of magnetic  dipoles which are suspended in a boiling medium.   As the boiling will  produce a somewhat random movement of the liquid, the movement or change in  the magnetic field will be highly random and thus not suitable for producing  a steady or reliable electrical current.  I have asked Martin Lin to also review the documents to render an independent  opinion of this proposal.  Respectfully,  Dr. Stinson Gibner PhD. Physics VP Research, Enron North America  P.S.   Kevin and Zimin:  If you have any interest in reviewing Mr. Pattesons  proposal, please let me know.

These recommendations are informed by the fact that I dont feel Anjam has  much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from  Enron:  HR-type stuff: 1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for  him to remain on the floor. 2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next.  IT-type stuff: 1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more  than a day or two. 2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjams h: drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has  deleted. 3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjams Notes folders, and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  Im worried  about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. 4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  Anjams c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

I certainly  appreciate the value-added that you provide in your research.I had a quick  question for you regarding any anticipated Japan central bank intervention at  the 15,000 level in the Nikkei. If I am understanding the mechanism correctly, BIS reserve requirements fall  below certain threshold and banks can no longer lend money and meet BIS  lending criteria due to improper reserve base. And this roughly happens at  15,000 level?  Reason I ask is Goldman Sachs put out an article suggesting that  break-evenpoint for bank holding of stocks is roughly 12,000-12,500 a  different index level than the one you have mentioned.    I can appreciate the difference between reserve liquidity and actual  break-even on equity positions, but just wanted to clarify this point with  you, as we are trying to gain a complete understanding of how a trigger would  effect Japanese capital markets. And so, as I currently understand it, there  are (2 ) trigger levels to watch:  15,000 where banks fail BIS criteria and hence cannot extend new loans with  BIS stamp of approval. Clearly ctl bank would have incentive in restoring  this or else financial system would be thrown into turmoil.  12500 where banks begin to take an actual loss on equity holdings  Is this right?

Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for  him to remain on the floor.  This will need to be delayed until IT number 1  is completed (cataloguing his work). 2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next. 3. Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in  the building.  Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work.  IT-type stuff: 1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more  than a day or two. 2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjams h: drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has  deleted. 3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjams Notes folders, and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  Im worried  about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out. 4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  Anjams c: drives.  There may be useful info here too. 5. Revoke all internet access, whether via Explorer or Notes mail. 6. Get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months.  Vince has OKd this lot, so lets do it ASAP.

Prof. Buehler is the  head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently,  he is writing a study about the hedging  strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would  like to get forward oil prices form us.  The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point  for the time period July 1986 and December 1996  with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be  ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly  or monthly data is helpful as well, of course.   Since Mannheim University is among Enrons tier one recruiting universities  in Germany, it would be great if we could help  him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.  Jens      o.korn@uni-mannheim.de on 10/10/2000 11:44:57 AM To: Jens.Gobel@enron.com cc:    Subject: Daten   Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,  bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof. Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie benoetigt wuerden.  Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle angibt:   In addition to the publicly available futures data described above, for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources made available some proprietary historical forward price curves from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine years  Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten verfuegbar hat.  Nun zum idealen Datensatz:  Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.  Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.  Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.  Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse  Olaf Korn   p.s.

Techmemos	<30576153.1075856596284.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	JCC	Good morning.  I apologize for the response delay.  Ive gone back through  the analysis that I did back in April, and have thrown around some ideas with  Vince and Stinson.  The issue may be summarized as follows.   The hedge relationship was derived using JCC and prompt Brent, and is valid  for JCC and prompt Brent.  No problems here.  However, it will not be valid  for points far out on the forward curve.  Intuitively, this hedge  relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve, but since  there is no data, I can not statistically determine this.  One can imagine a  term structure of heding ratios that start at 0.67 and move to 1.0, so that  the back end of the curves would move together, but how fast it converges to  one is anyones guess.   If there is a way of determining the historical JCC forward curve, then the  hedge relationships may be estimated.  However, I have been unable to  determine a rigorous approach to building the JCC curve.     I can explain this far better in person, and would like to talk as soon as  possible at your convenience.   -Kevin Kindall	Kevin Kindall kevin.kindall@enron.com	enron.com	Marc De La Roche marc.roche@enron.com	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com  Stinson Gibner stinson.gibner@enron.com	2000-10-30T10:55:00+00:00

I think that  I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me  know.  Please dont share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of  Enron.  Regards, Tim  New Cap Specifics On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a  new price cap methodology. The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as  can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to  achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date  might be. The new price cap methodology will remain in place until: Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven  to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions. Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal. Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the  following heat rate table:   Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap   <25 GW   10,775   $43.10   25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70   30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90   35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90   >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment. Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps. The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior  to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISOs two day-ahead  system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior  to the hour of delivery.  FERC Context FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000. The ISO has asserted that they dont need FERC authority since it is a bid  cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of  electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices. The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.   FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days  after their authority expires) FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its  206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We dont know  what they will find or what they will propose. The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will  likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on  11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral  comments. Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price  caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations. It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into  effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC  extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from  the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.  Impact of Price Caps The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at  different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets  would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to  say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap  because we dont know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the  cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below. Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.    Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new  price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices. Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets. Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.   For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January  through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January  through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400  from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual  observations. We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the  calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices  for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each  hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour  could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly  average cap value! The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000  NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power  prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

Techmemos	<16817665.1075856596207.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Alliance Info Alert: FERC Report on Western Markets	At its special meeting today, FERC released the results of its eagerly  awaited probe into Californias summer power crisis, concluding that under  certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and  unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market  structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions  throughout the West.  The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer 2000  Price Abormalities, entitled, Part I of Staff Report on U.S. Bulk Power  Markets, is available at the following website:  http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm  In response, FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural  changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems, and  solicited public comment by November 22.  A technical conference has also  been scheduled for November 9, to discuss the proposed solutions and other  remedies that might be suggested (details TBA).  While all four commissioners  supported the order, the order stretched the Commission.  Chairman Hoecker  and Comm. Breathitt expressed strong endorsements, while Comms. Hebert and  Massey concurred, citing areas where they felt the Commission had either  over-reached or not gone far enough, as discussed below.  A final order is  expected to be issued by years end.  At the same time, the Commission warned California consumers of their  continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve  state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day  ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3)  siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient  reserve requirements.  Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy  In its order, FERC proposed a series of market overhauls, including:  (1) Eliminating the states mandatory requirement that the states  investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other  alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.  (2) Requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their  transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for  under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in  order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market.  (3) Establishing independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the ISO  and PX.  (4) Modifying the current single price auction system by (a) imposing a  temporary $150/MWh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of $150  from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders; (b) requiring sellers  bidding above $150/MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, weekly  basis and provide certain cost support; and (c) requiring the ISO and PX to  report monthly information on such bids.  The Commissions price mitigation  measures would remain in effect through December 31, 2002.  (5) Declining to order retroactive refunds for the states ratepayers and  utilities, citing insufficient authority to do so, but subjecting sellers to  potential refund liability for transactions from October 2, 2000 until  December 21, 2002, but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs, if  FERC finds non-competitive behavior.  (6) Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand  response management programs.  Separately, the draft order rejected the ISOs request for an extension of  its current purchase price cap authority, and the PXs request for price  capping authority.  Commissioner Responses  Comm. Herbert reluctantly concurred, noting that his decision may change when  a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at  the November 9 meeting.  He stressed that he would have preferred that the  order address four areas: (1) eliminate all price controls in California  markets; (2) abolish the single price auction entirely; (3) terminate the  buy and sell mandate in the PX; and (4) direct the ISO to address a long  list of cited problems in its January 2001 RTO filing, rather than having the  Commission prescribe specific remedies.  Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap  concept, if one had to be adopted, then the soft cap should increase  incrementally increase over time at specific pre-announced dates.  He  believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in  facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive  for California regulators to address market design and other flaws.  Also, he  would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time, but  allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January 2001 RTO  filings.  In addition, he would not dictate risk management methods,  preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on  their own.  Finally, he advised Californians not to be so environmentally  focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation  capacity.  Comm. Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC  cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress  towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that it was the Commissions  job to guide the market to self-correct and not to conduct command and  control.  She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX, saying that  they have performed admirably.  However, she noted she is awaiting comments  on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential  reporting requirements.  Comm. Massey concurred, but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive  approach.  He feels that the Congress has put its thumb on the scale in the  Federal Power Act to protect consumers.  Stating that prices will continue to  be unreasonable in the future, he believes that this Order moves in the right  direction, by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over  reliance on the spot market, lack of demand response, the need to  reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buy/sell  mandate.  Comm. Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the  $150/MWh soft cap went far enough, whether FERC has the legal authority to  issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a  certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market  price volatility.  Finally, Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order, but noted  that this is no time to pull punches.  He emphasized that the Commission  needed frank comments from the industry.  He echoed Comm. Breathitts warning  that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on  track.  Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds, he  stated that the responsibility rests with Congress.  Addressing  jurisdictional issues, he stated that siting problems encountered at the  state level are slowing the meandering transition to competition.  He feels  that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these  problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power.  Rather, California  is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region  for reliable energy, thus placing the burden on federal action to make things  work, Hoecker maintained.  The Chairman also said that the Commission will  fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further  evidence provided by staffs ongoing investigation.

Techmemos	<20096932.1075856596137.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: digitals	Pavel, Many thanks for your note.  I understand that Digitals are not core Enron business but as you know, Im  trying to explore Digitals to give, for example, a company a guaranteed  income in year one (to mop up expiring tax losses). This  is offset by a  guaranteed expense in year two. See attached hypothetical example. The  digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to  and would be part of a price risk management strategy, thereby giving it  commercial purpose.   I would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject --  the  rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets  (electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector).  It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a value judgement or am I  wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate  this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or  likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it  becomes non arms length and does not pass the smell test?  Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also  be appreciated.  Gillian.      From: Pavel Zadorozhny on 02/11/2000 15:15 CST To: Gillian Lockwood/LON/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: digitals  Digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market. Nobody ever  asked me to show quotes in the OTC market. The only time we encountered them  was when producers, brought by our marketing team, wanted to sell a  knock-outable swap, whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange  for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level. This  structure had a digital put embedded in it, although the customers didnt  necessarilly know that. The companies were US oil and gas producers: Venoco,  Titan, Magnum Hunter, Patiena Oil & Gas, Belco, Central Resources. It was  about 1 year ago. In the OTC market, at about the same time, I asked for  quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital Cal 00 $16 swaption to  Elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that I cannot recall.  I hope this helps.

As you are aware much of the work  requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the  significant contribution that Amitavas experience and expertise has provided  in a very short timeframe.  As you might expect, this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated  support from someone with Amitavas background.  It is imperative that we  leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights  into our project.  This will not only speed up the work considerably but also  ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us.  I would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure Amitava is more  integrated into our efforts.  I realize it will be difficult to free him up  but maybe we can put something together which works for everybody.  some early ideas:    have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support.  this  should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant  effort for the project and then continue with Amitava a full time EC.com  resource working from Houston.  This is likely my preference.  or  agree a schedule of regular trips which allows Amitava to provide critical  insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract  his experience on an ongoing basis.  Lets discuss before I talk to john about the practicalities  Thanks for your assistance.

Techmemos	<30824033.1075856596092.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Ethylene Margin Collar Model	Dear All:   Let us meet early this afternoon.   Here is the overview of the model:  1)The Ethylene margin collars are priced using Asian Spread option.    The forward curve and volatility curve are provided by the desk.   The correlation between the Ethylene and Ethylene cost starts from the   historical spot correlation 50% and grows with the maturity.  2) The overall 40MM payout cap is modeled sepereately.      I fitted the historical spread ( 10 years data ) to a mean reverting model    with stronger mean reverting strength on the floor side.  The model  produces    trajectories that are statistically simular to the historical data.     Then the expected payoff is computed through simulation.   At the meeting we will discuss the assumptions and present the results.

London	<14252419.1075856609132.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Sharads Houston visit	Sharad  As expected we didnt get time to discuss in detail what to do in Houston.   We have discussed the subject informally, but Im laying it out here for  clarity, and for Vince/Stinsons information.  Here are my thoughts:  1. Exotica.  This is the top priority, as youd rightly identified yourself.  a. Learn how to build xlls.  b. Catalogue functions in Houston Exotica not yet available in London.  c. Catalogue differences between inputs to London and Houston Exotica  functions.  d. Produce London xll that allows current function calls to be used where  possible, and incorporates new functions.  e. Update documentation as appropriate.  If you do nothing else in your two weeks, Ill be very happy with this.   Main contacts are Paulo and Zimin.  2. Understand American Monte Carlo (AMC).  The aim is to get a feel for AMCs  characteristics.  Before we embark on the use of AMC for real option  valuation, Id like to understand how it behaves for financial options.  I  suggest something like the following:  a. Produce AMC code for single GBM for American option.  Compare Greeks  against those from appropriate tree methods.  b. Two GBM spread option model, to compare against 1-d numerical integration  method.  Although the American bit of AMC isnt going to be used here, it  will be interesting to think about the bucketing issue in price/payoff space  and, again, the Greeks.  c. Some form of mean reverting model, preferably two factor.  d. HJM for pure financial option valuation.  If you get somewhere on a-d, and AMC behaves sensibly on pure financial  models, then Ill be very keen to roll it out for real option valuations.  Vince/Stinson - since Im expecting the worst from IT i.t.o. email support,  would you be good enough to print this email out and hand it to Sharad?

Projects	<16326270.1075856591392.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Ethylene margin collar simulation model	I set up the simulation model.  The margin follows a mean-reverting process.  I seperarted the data into two category, margin >0.04  and margin <0.04. Then I estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets. I got higher mean reverting speed than that I estimated using the whole data  set.  The high MR speed surpresses the probability at high payout side. Since the MR speed is sensitive to where I divide the data, so Bob will run  a few senarios.  I put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium  calculation, so the the result in E18 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal  pricing. I also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar  worth.  Relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread  option approach that Bob and Lee set up.    Look like we got a reasonable model.    Stinson: Id like to have you check my set up for the simulation model.  Lee and Douglas: You can play with the model, and let me know what do you think.  Bob: We need  run different price curve senarios using the simulation model.    plus different MR speed.

Techmemos	<27485829.1075856595980.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Alliance Info Alert - FERC Reporting	Attached is a summary of recent FERC activities (PDF file) and the weekly  Alliance Express. The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting,  followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings.  In a brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section 203  merger filing requirements, generally as proposed, and extended the existing  NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be  determined to be workably competitive.  At the same time, FERC ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next  steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation.  Additional details are  provided below.  FERC Updates, Streamlines Merger Filing Process  FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers.  However, Comm. Hebert did so with reservations, as  discussed below.  Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued, but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry.  Staff stated that the Order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products.  According to FERC, the draft Order:  -  revises the Commissions filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on FERCs 1996 Merger Policy Guidelines; -  provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses.  The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns.  In addition, the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses. -  streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns; and -  reduces the industrys regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements.  The Rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal  Register.  Commissioner Reaction:  Comm. Hebert expressed reservations that, although he was voting for the  Rule, FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) market concentration analyses and that FERC  should follow the lead of anti-trust enforcement officials, who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially. He also stated that FERC  should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them, not before,  and that there should be a definite time frame for review.  Hebert did  mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt, that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis.  Comm. Breathitt supported the Final Rule, stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older, irrelevant requirements have been dropped.  She indicated  that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be efficient yet  sufficient.  The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns, confidentiality.  Comm. Massey fully supported the Final Rule, emphasizing that it would  improve response time, lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict Commission actions.  Like Commissioner Breathitt,  Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high.  Massey also  stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERCs  concerns, such as future mergers when they occur in succession, retail  competition, mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and  analysis of ancillary services.  In sum, he averred that the Order will  provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis, while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry.  Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important Rule.  In response to Comm. Hebert, Chairman Hoecker said  that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERCs report before issuing their  own, that the anti-trust enforcement agencies rely on FERCs expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries.  There is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work, he noted.  Because the  RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market, he indicated, RTOs will help to  preserve competition.  Therefore, more and larger RTOs should allow for more  mergers, he said.  The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger, but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably.  NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably  Competitive  In a 3-1 decision, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, FERC extended the existing  NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be  workably competitive.  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and  deadlines for resolution/implementation.  In so doing, FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISOs September 1 and 8, 2000  compliance filing, submitted pursuant to its May 31, 2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through October 31.  The ISOs efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the Commissions directives, FERC concluded.  FERC found  that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas, overall the  ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISOs non-spinning reserve  market by April 2001, as the ISO requested.  Commissioner Reaction:  Comms. Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an imperfect  solution, yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  ISOs market.  Comm. Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls.  Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the ISOs progress, but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted.  In other action, FERC accepted NYISOs and NEPOOLs proposed Emergency Energy  Transaction Agreement, allowing NYISO and ISO-NE to provide emergency service  to each other (ER00-3638-000);  Stricken items included CAE-16 (NEPOOLs 64th Agreement Amendment proposing  the elimination of In Service and instituting new rules governing certain  import transactions (ER00-3577-000)).                                 == RECENT FERC FILINGS ==  (1) RTO DEVELOPMENTS  *  ISO NE submitted its changes to Market Rule 17, Market Monitoring,  Reporting and Market Power Mitigation, in compliance with the Commissions  July 26, 2000 Order.

We submitted a  bid to BP yesterday where BP would pay Enron just under $5 MM to assume the  contract.  We have yet to have further discussions, so theres not much more  to report than that.  We greatly appreciate your help on this project.  I  feel like we put together a very good bid, and measured the risks  appropriately with limited time.

London	<8350980.1075856609001.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: VaR for EnronCredit.com	Bryan,  We shall be glad to  take a look at the system. To sign - off on the vendor  provided system we have to look under the hood and review the algorithms. I hope the vendor will  have no objections to it.  Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the  system you want to buy with the rest of VaR/credit systems. We shall stand by to help in this  endeavor.  An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be  rolled into the existing risk systems.

As you know one of the key limits at the Board level is Value at  Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our  approach for calculating VaR.  We have implemented a third party risk system  which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt  positions in.  The system has a VaR engine which is being demod by the  vendor today.  Ben and Kirstee are attending the demo and if they find the  technology acceptable, I propose moving forward with implemantion of the  module.  Pls. let me know if this sounds reasonable and how you would  envision implementing.  thanks	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com	enron.com	Bryan Seyfried bryan.seyfried@enron.com	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com  Steven Leppard steven.leppard@enron.com  Rick Buy rick.buy@enron.com  Ted Murphy ted.murphy@enron.com  Tanya Tamarchenko tanya.tamarchenko@enron.com	2000-11-10T14:11:00+00:00

Thanks a lot for your help again. Have a great weekend.  Jens    Jens Gobel 10/26/2000 12:06 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:    Subject: Forward oil prices     Vince,  As discussed on the phone, I am sending you the request that I have received  from Prof. Buehler. Prof. Buehler is the  head of the faculty of finance at Mannheim University in Germany. Currently,  he is writing a study about the hedging  strategy that led to the Metallgesellschaft debacle. For this study he would  like to get forward oil prices form us.  The forward oil prices should be for WTI with Cushing as the delivery point  for the time period July 1986 and December 1996  with remaining contract durations between one and ten years. It would be  ideal to get this data on a daily basis. Weekly  or monthly data is helpful as well, of course.   Since Mannheim University is among Enrons tier one recruiting universities  in Germany, it would be great if we could help  him with some data. Thanks a lot for your help.  Jens      o.korn@uni-mannheim.de on 10/10/2000 11:44:57 AM To: Jens.Gobel@enron.com cc:    Subject: Daten   Sehr geehrter Herr Goebel,  bezugnehmend auf Ihr heutiges Telefongespraech mit Herrn Prof. Buehler hat mich Prof. Buehler gebeten, Ihnen genauer darzustellen, welche Daten idealerweise fuer unsere Studie benoetigt wuerden.  Zunaechst zum Hintergrund. Wir sind auf ENRON gestossen, weil Eduardo Schwartz in einer seiner Arbeiten die folgende Datenquelle angibt:   In addition to the publicly available futures data described above, for the purpose of this study Enron Capital and Trade Resources made available some proprietary historical forward price curves from 1/15/93 to 5/16/96. From these data ten forward prices were used in estimation, ranging in maturities from two months to nine years  Dies laesst uns annehmen, dass Enron bestimmte Daten verfuegbar hat.  Nun zum idealen Datensatz:  Forwardoelpreise (am besten WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing) fuer Restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn Jahren fuer den Zeitraum Juli 1986 bis Dezember 1996. Dabei waere eine hohe Datenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich oder monatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mit Lieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.  Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht erfuellen lassen. Jedoch waere uns auch schon geholfen, wenn ein kuerzerer Zeitraum oder eine niedrigere Datenfrequenz vorlaege.  Wir waernen Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie in Erfahrung bringen koennten, inwiefern solche Daten von Enron zu erhalten sind.  Herzlichen Dank fuer Ihre Muehe und beste Gruesse  Olaf Korn   p.s.

Techmemos	<32590747.1075856595932.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: looking for Fat Tails in time-series for NGI-SOCAL	Vince,                 I quite agree, we have to separate out price and position,  and that is what we have done with the historical simulations/EVT ideas.  We  have taken todays delta-gamma, hold that frozen, and gone back historically  and looked at price changes and see what happens to portfolio changes.     Garman and company have looked at gross historical portfolio changes, which I  agree is not the best approach, due to the artificiality imposed by largest  Net Open Positions (NOP), such as we have seen recently.           Regards Naveen       Vince J Kaminski@ECT 11/13/2000 10:31 AM To: Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vladimir  Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Re: looking for Fat Tails in time-series for NGI-SOCAL    Tanya, Naveen,  Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes  of prices and positions. This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas  portfolio. A big jump in the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price  movement may produce an observation that looks artificially big.  If the volumetric position was frozen, its just a scaling factor and there  should be  no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach is to separate the price process from the position changes.

A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an  extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree  for a single contract log-returns, they dont divide by vols.

For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:  [ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)  and compared the results to normal distribution.   I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails!   Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large  returns more frequent than normal),  which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

The major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at Open  price which will affect the P/L.  I also added the output features that John wants to see.  The cumulative P/L is path dependent, the Net Open Allowed seemingly has a strong influence on the cumulative P/L trajectory.  (the anomaly I  discussed  with Vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further  examination).  Could you review what I have done before we talk to John again ?

The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike  payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be  discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values. 2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree  approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature  method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities. 3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for  anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation  since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Projects	<7956041.1075856591104.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	WTI maket maker simulation model	John,  We finished the Version 2 of the simulation model which deals with the open-close trading versus the continuous trading in the previous version.  I added the cummulative P/L as an output.   There are a few apparent trading strategies from this model:  1) Higher bid/offer spread, more profit 2) More Daily # of trades, more profit 3) Smaller net open positions allowed, more profit  1) and 2) are obvious, but 3) is more interesting.  It means that we are  better off if we do not allowed net open positions at end of the day.  In a trending  market, this makes an intuitive sense, for example, in the case of bull market we are  short as a market maker and we can avoid the loss at the higher openning price by keeping zero or small net short positions.  I have attached the model with this mail, and Ill  be happy to discuss the  model in more details with you.

The P/L results are investigated by assuming different scenarios.  The key variable is the number of trade per day, therefore is varied  from  200 to 1000 trades.  Scenarios are generated by different spreads, net open position allowed, and  time period.  Take a look what I have prepared, and let me know things you want to add or  delete. If you have any questions, I will be happy to discuss with you.    Zimin  PS: this presentation is only for the open-close trading.

Projects	<13161948.1075856591060.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	PSerc Denver Meeting	Vince, The PSerc meeting Lance and I went to was both interesting and boring. PSerc has 11 school members  and 30 industry members. Its Research Program consists of three stems:  Markets, Transmission and Distribution, and Systems. (Enrons interests probably lie mainly in the first stem.)   In morning of the first day, researchers from universities presented their project proposals. I found some of them  quite interesting. For example, Shmuel Oren, Fernando Alvarado, Tim Mount (of Cornell) propose to study Market Redesign: Incorporating the lessons learned from actual experiences for enhancing market design,  Shijie Deng, S. Oren et al propose to study  Power asset valuation model in a market-based and reliability-constrained electric power system. The first got funded but the second did not.   In the same afternoon industry and academic separated to have their own discussion. I went to the academic discussion and Lance the industry one.  I hope my presence there did not make things worse, for the discussion revealed a lot of organizational chaos and confusion.  The proposal screen process got a lot of heat from participants.   The proposal process goes as follows: researchers first write a short  proposal to appropriate stem committee (no industry participantion, it seems  to me), each committee then ranks the proposal and selects the top 3 or 4. The  selected proposals are then expanded to be present to the industry.  Industry then gets to vote which proposals get funded.  However, some researchers were very unhappy about the initial ranking and selection process. There were accusation of self-ranking, communication between stem committee and member schools breaking down, and so on. Some were even asking for  some sort of assurance that the project will be funded even before  wrting it  (the arguement was Then it was a waste of our time to write proposals,  which I found quite amusing).   All in all, I found the process was not taken seriously enough by university  researchers. PSerc has been established for 5 years now and it still does  not have a proper proposal screen process, which is hard to believe. Also,  the communication among university researchers, between stem committee  and member schools, and most importantly, between researchers and industry,  are not  smooth as all.  Since the proposals are voted by 30 or so industry members, the right projects may not get funded. Too many participants also make the decision process very indecisive and quite painful to watch (Lance can comment on this better).  They also wanted to spread the fund among all schools which made the voting a less authoritive.  I believe Enron will not get much returns from join PSerc (price tag is  $40,000 per company per year).  If we find some projects interesting, we can sponsor the schools in the form of summer interns, the schools claim that most of the  fund goes to support students anyway.

Techmemos	<19898344.1075856595755.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Adaptive Trade	Vince, Zimin, I participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning.  There  was a possibility Enron would invest in it.  Their product appears to be a GUI interface over the top of ILOG Solver (and  possibly ILOG CPLEX) which allows problems to be expressed in high level  terms.  I do not see any immediate application at Enron, but I am interested  in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo.  Maybe it would be  useful for general modelling projects here.  They do not even have a user manual for their software, so it will be  difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged.  The  possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ILOG software is a  modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that  market.  I think the scheduling tools in SAP, i2, etc are more likely to  succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information  system.  Because of the small market for this software, the many competitors, the  absence of any clear use for it at Enron and the early stage of development,  there is very little prospect of us funding this company.

Weve combined a powerful chronological dispatch  model with the capability to simulate the market from 1 day to 25+ years.  Add to that a Risk Analysis section, powered by user selectable Monte  Carlo &/or Latin Hypercube modeling, enough Portfolio Analysis power to please the toughest critic, & inputs and outputs from standard EXCEL &  ACCESS tables and youve got one of most powerful tools in the market.   Just a few months ago we expanded our emissions modeling capabilities, added our quarterly database update, increased the speed of the entire  model, and made   But that wasnt enough.   Weve done it again.  Some of the operations that weve included...     Two new reporting enhancements.      The first is marginal reporting for fuels, resources and groups of resources.      The second is the ability to display resource stack information in graphical and dispatch order form.    Other enhancements include dual fuel modeling, improved transmission modeling, greater access to hourly results, and the ability to model  monthly emission rates.  Moreover, the databases for Central and Eastern, Texas, and Western markets have been updated to use the new  modeling capabilities.   We continue to make AURORA easier to use.  This version enhances user control over modeling, editing inputs, and viewing of AURORA output.   Clients desiring to exploit the power of AURORA now have greater control over the inputs and outputs through VB Scripting in AURORA.  The new  update data capability provides a means to universally change any data element.   Attached is more information on the fastest and most flexible tool of its kind.

Techmemos	<21351753.1075856595482.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Alliance Info Alert	Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:  This Alliance Info Alert includes three items of interest: 1)  The weekly Alliance Express newsletter 2)  Listing of recent filings at FERC 3)  Timeline for FERC action on California Markets  (attached)                          Alliance of Energy Suppliers Express=02=05December 1= 9, 2000  INSIDE WASHINGTON  =02=05 FEDERAL AFFAIRS  ***FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural Reforms*= **  At a special meeting Friday afternoon, FERC unanimously approved its eagerl= y awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting th= e major outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to California the responsibility for addressing state-related matters.  At the=  same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well=  as the imposition of region-wide price caps.  FERC reiterated their earlier=  conclusions that under certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to Californias seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the West.  FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, the=  states mandatory requirement that the states investor-owned utilities buy=  and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to purchase=  electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to=  manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PXs rate schedules effective at=  the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman James Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California wholesale market established under the states restructuring law, returning=  ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public=  Utilities Commission (CPUC).  The agency also modified the effective period of the $150/MWh soft cap proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures must b= e in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early nex= t year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can=  be place by the May 1, deadline.  ***Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolst= er Californias Supplies***  Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained=  power supply situation in California by issuing an order, pursuant to Secti= on 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to require generators and marketers to mak= e power available to meet the states electricity needs.  The emergency directive requires that, if the California independent system operator (ISO= ) certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity, certain suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have=  power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm=  customers. Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power=  exchange (PX) and the ISO over the last 30 days that have firm capacity available would be subject to the order.  Under the order, the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9:00 pm=  EST on the day before the requested service.  The ISO must, to the extent=  feasible, allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each suppliers available power.  The price for the power provided pursuant to t= he order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier.  If no=  agreement is reached, FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at = a later date.   The order will remain in effect until 3:00 am EST on December=  21, 2000 unless modified.  ***EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants Mercury Emissions***  EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in a long-awaited announcement, indicated=  last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants.  The agency stated that it=  plans to propose new regulations in December 2003, and hopes to finalize ne= w rules by December 2004.  In the wake of the decision, EEI called on EPA to make certain that any program to control utilities mercury emissions be based on the best scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi= c health.  EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key scientific and technological issues, said Paul Bailey, EEI Vice President,=  Environmental Affairs.  Given these uncertainties, EEI is disappointed that=  the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science, said Mr. Bail= ey.  In the meantime, the electric power industry will continue to work with al= l stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions=  from power plants may be needed, and how those cuts should be achieved, Mr= . Bailey concluded.  MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS   ***Calpine Completes Acquisition of EMI Power Assets***  Calpine Corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of=  power assets from Energy Management, Inc. (EMI).  In the deal, Calpine acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed, combined-cyc= le power generating facilities located in New England, as well as a joint marketing venture between Calpine and EMI.  Prior to the transaction, Calpi= ne held a 50 percent net interest in the projects.  We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and highly efficient power plants.  The Dighton, Tiverton, and Rumford faciliti= es were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in=  New England, said Calpine Senior Vice President Bob Alff.  Combined with=  our other announced project in the Northeast, we have created a coordinated=  system of low-cost assets, with excellent geographic diversity, to provide=  power to a very attractive New England market, added Alff.  ***Exelon Completes Acquisition of 49.9 Percent of Sithe***  Exelon Corporation and Sithe Energies have announced the completion of Exelons acquisition of 49.9 percent of the stock of Sithe.  The completion=  of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which PECO Energy Company agre= ed to purchase 49.9 percent of Sithes assets in North America for $682 million.  PECO has since merged with Unicom Corporation to form Exelon Corporation.  Under the terms of the agreement, Exelon has the option to purchase the remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe within two to five years at a price based o= n prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised.  Exelon=  and Sithe will continue to operate independently, said the companies.  ENERGY DATA  *** Weekly Electric Output (Week 50)***  Electric output reached 74,737 GWh for the week ending December 9 (Week 50)= , with the highest increase over 1999 levels in the Mid-Atlantic region, whic= h had a 15.8 percent increase over 1999.  Looking at year-to-date information= , the Pacific Southeast leads the nation in growth of output.  For more information, email alliance@eei.org.  WHOS WHO  ***Allegheny Energy Announces Leadership Change***  Allegheny Energy, Inc. this week announced the appointment of Michael Morrell, Senior Vice President and CFO, as President of its unregulated supply business, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, effective February 1, 2001.  Morrell will replace Peter Skrgic, current President, who will be retiring on that date after 37 years of service to the company.  In his new position, Mr. Morrell will direct and continue the growth of Alleghenys energy supply business, which operates and markets competitive=  retail and wholesale electric generation throughout the eastern US.  Additionally, Morrell will identify new opportunities to expand the Company= s generation holdings, announced a press release.

Techmemos	<10304978.1075856595456.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	My model for spikes	Dear Dr. Kaminski,  I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sincerely yours,  Valery Kholodnyi Manager of Quantitative Analysis Research and Analytics Group TXU Energy Trading  PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:  1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes  and Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00,  July 2000. 2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000. 3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000. 4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at  Two Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000. 5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.  As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes.

On another note, I would be glad to meet you for lunch/dinner sometimes during the next few weeks.  Please, let me know what would be the best time to meet.  Vince   Vincent Kaminski Managing Director - Research Enron Corp. 1400 Smith Street Room EB1962 Houston, TX 77002-7361  Phone: (713) 853 3848 Fax  :  (713) 646 2503 E-mail: vkamins@enron.com     Valery Kholodnyi <vkholod1@txu.com> on 12/20/2000 03:13:09 PM To: vkamins@enron.com cc:   Subject: My model for spikes     Dear Dr. Kaminski,  I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be interested in receiving this preprint.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Sincerely yours,  Valery Kholodnyi Manager of Quantitative Analysis Research and Analytics Group TXU Energy Trading  PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:  1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes  and Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00,  July 2000. 2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000. 3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000. 4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at  Two Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000. 5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with  Spikes, Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.  As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the absence of spikes.

Stanford	<27323967.1075856630910.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Stanford Project	Nick,  Thanks for your message. My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays and  this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford. I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend. Lets plan to meet for dinner then.  I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research   project. We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it. It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection of the research topics.  We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns. Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall  welcome him with open arms.  I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the  arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford.

If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, lets get together some time to have dinner.  I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!  We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into the problem/opportunity generation environment. That really helps the  student to develop a realistic vision about their research.  Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter, say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of  course you could visit us before that too.

The  Henwood person who will coordinate the project is David Branchcomb, located  in London. He will have to involve the Henwood ?manager for Asia, who works  out of Australia.   I told him that you would call him Wednesday morning on his cell phone to set  up a conference call later the same day with the guy in Australia. Given time  difference it may happen late afternoon.   They expect that we shall give them the specs of the project. It makes sense  to involve Sandeep at the conference call: he will be very specific about our  needs. I sent you his coordinates in an earlier message. Sandeep may have to  come to the office: I dont know if Anita knows how to set up a conference  call.   Davids phone numbers:   44 207 242 8950  44 787 942 5375 (cell).

He will email a  Henwood proposal to us.  They already figured that we must be interested in  modelling Dabhol. 2.  The WTI EOL trading simulation had an error.   We were counting a  mid-offer spread profit on each trade, but we actually would make the spread  on each round-trip transaction (one trade to open, one trade to close).    I  modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to Greg Whalley (he is the  one who caught the mistake, so there goes my bonus for the year.) and John  Lavorato.   I should probably re-run the earning volatility numbers, and  update Ted Murphy as well.  --Stinson	Stinson Gibner stinson.gibner@enron.com	enron.com	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com	vkaminski@aol.com vkaminski@aol.com	2000-12-27T20:16:00+00:00
Techmemos	<17595563.1075856595367.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Combinatorial Auction - Jan 11 mtg background	----- Forwarded by Greg Woulfe/Enron Communications on 12/28/00 09:58 AM -----   Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON  12/22/00 05:08 PM        To: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Woulfe/Enron Communications@Enron  Communications    cc:     Subject: Combinatorial Auction  Stinson and Greg,  I have read the paper Combinatorial Auction with Multiple Winners for  Universal Service from Richard Steinberg and Frank Kelly. They propose a  combinatorial auction which is an auction for multiple items that allows  bidders to realize their synergies on combinations of items. The  combinatorial auction is appropriated for bandwidth commodity because most  bidders in the market have synergies on the combination of items. For  example, if we want to get bandwidth between Boston and DC, we would bid for  Boston-NY and NY-DC. It will be valuable to us only if we won both links. If  we won only one link, it will be useless.  In the paper, they propose the auctioning method but their method has not  been tested or validated yet. I have not checked their proposition  mathematically but their paper was published in Management Science so I think  it should be all right. I will look at it in more details and let you know.  Anyhow, there are also other combinatorial auctions that are actually used,  for example, the Alberta governments PPA auction that Enron Canada was  participated 3-4 months ago.  Based on our long position on bandwidth, Auction and Exchange might be a good  channel to dispose our unused (or unsold) bandwidth. I know there is not much  demand in the market. But if we open a combinatorial auction or exchange, we  might be able to increase our market share. (by taking demand from our  competitors). I believe, at the moment, there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow combinatorial bids. If we are the first one to do it, we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share. (Note: Auction -> one  seller and many buyers: Exchange -> many sellers and many buyers.)  Moreover, I think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway. In addition, we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction. If the current wining bid is too low, we  can just over-bid it and keep the product. This way, we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products.  Lets meet sometime in the first week of January. -Chonawee	Greg Woulfe greg.woulfe@enron.com	enron.com	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com  Russell Woody russell.woody@enron.com  Marcello Romano marcello.romano@enron.com  Paul Racicot paul.racicot@enron.com  Jim Fallon jim.fallon@enron.com		2000-12-28T09:51:00+00:00
Techmemos	<25240240.1075856595344.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Seasonal factors and curve fitting	I have written a C++ code to do the following: For a given curve, the code will filter out the seasonal factor.  It then fits the deseasoned curve to a smooth function of the form  f(t)=a+A/(t+B)c, with 0<c<.5. ?The curve fitting is achieved by using Conjugate Gradient method. ??As Tanya pointed out, this form of function ensures that  ?f(t)2*t - f(t-1)2*(t-1) >0, which is useful in calculating forward-forward ?vol. ?The outputs are season patterns (2 different patterns are allowed)?and the smoothed curve.  One can then calculate forward-forward vol?from the smoothed curve and superimpose the seasonal factors back?onto the curve.??This procedure is not useful for VaR calcuation. However, I believe it ?is useful for other situations which require the knowledge of  seasonal ?forward-forward vols.  For example, in power plant valuation and?credit exposure simulations, it would reflect the reality more closely?if we add seasonality to our forward-forward vol in simulating the forward?prices. ??Attached are the spreadsheet and XLL file.

Projects	<6632336.1075856589903.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	EOL WTI Historical Trade Simulation - more profitable trading strategy	Please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some  typos.    Greg and John,  I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially  because in a trending market we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose  market move from $30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread  is $1 for simplicity, we take 5  trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is  (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading  volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one  trade, the total MTM is  -5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $10,000 for that particular day.  Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades, we can be more profitable as a market maker.    I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30,000 BBL. I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3.  Almost in all cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked Change for  dollar amount change in millions.  Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Best wishes for the New Year.    It would certainly be great to see you and to meet Eric some time in the ne= xt few months.     Everyone here was very impressed with Giuseppe and we are eager to have another of your=  students come to Enron.  Enron Broadband is continuing to evolve and the current vision is to rely o= n Enrons trading expertise while trying to minimize our role as an engineering company and innovator of technology.   = I spoke recently with Jim Fallon, the current head trader in EBS, and we put together a short list of topics of interest=  where you might be able to help educate us. I put these in the order of interest (to Mr. Fallon).  1.   Where will bandwidth prices go?   The direction of prices, obviously i= s the concern of any trader.   We realize that technological innovation will continue to drive down prices, but are still=  interested in trying to quantify how fast prices will fall,  if there are likely to be certain bottlenecks in the fiber network where yo= u could see prices stable or rising for some length of time,  if there are applications on the horizon which would use such prodigious amounts of bandwidth as to have some effect on pricing, and if there is a rational way of trying to quantify the timing and effect = on prices of new technologies.  The term bandwidth might primarily mean lit fiberoptic capacity, but cou= ld also incompass dark fiber, or IP transit and transport pricing.  2.  During the last year, Enron purchased a company known as Warpspeed in=  order to acquire their MetaRouter technology.   To quote from the Enron pre= ss release:  MetaRouter sends signals throughout distributed networks to determine the=  optimal connectivity paths for any size bandwidth capacity from anywhere in=  the world. Capable of processing thousands of connections per second, MetaRouter significantly enhances Enron=01,s ability to automate circuit provisioning.  There may be two separate questions to ask here.   First,  in the context o= f the current market (or the market which may develop in the next 1-2 years),=  will the MetaRouter be a commercially viable product?   That is,  will it=  address an actual need in the market, or would it be more cost effective ju= st to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits?  The second question (our first real technical question):  is the MetaRouter=  technology scalable?     Before starting on this project, Vince and I will=  need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are implementing this technology.  3.  Aggregation of loads.   A recurring question comes from a number of are= as such as IP, network storage, and   streaming media transport sales:  What=  value can I get form aggregating customers, each of which has some type of=  stochastic load profile?   Giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates t= o IP transport, but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail.   =  The main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual=  customer data.   I am told that in a few months we will have some more usef= ul history.   My understanding is that what will be available will be 5-minute=  averages of usage, so we still will not know on a short time scale what the=  distribution of load looks like.   I hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our=  concerns are at this point.   Please let me know your thoughts about these=  topics.   I would expect, for instance that question number 1 may not be reasonable as a research project, but might be a question which you would=  feel comfortable in addressing by giving us  your qualitative opinions, may= be in the form of a talk here at Enron.      Again,  let me know your thoughts, and I look forward to seeing you again=  soon.

If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, lets get together some time to have dinner.  I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!  We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into the problem/opportunity generation environment. That really helps the student to develop a realistic vision about their research.  Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quart= er, say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing.

What about the trip on Monday. Has it been scheduled?

Ben, please let me know when things are ready; I can plan my trip accordingly. Thanks,  Amitava    EnronCredit.com is working on 3 main models --- the FMC model, the Placement  model, and the Movement model. FMC Model : provides credit default swap price curves for 16 ratings with 33  industry offsets.  Each day, this model takes the previous days trader  curves and adjusts them for the movement in Bloomberg yields and observed  swap prices. Placement Model : uses linear regression to credit default swap prices using  dummified ranges for Market Capitalization, Liquidity, KMV Score, etc.  One  main issue here is that the dataset is biased towards investment grade  names.  Alternate approaches looked at developing separate models for  separate sunsets of names. Movement Model : provides an alert system for news.  This is under  development.  Current involvement of Houston Research Group members is in the  development/modifications of the Placement Model, especially in thinking  through the various single vs multi model approaches.  We can help in the  brainstorming for better models for subsets.  One main project right now is  to get a separate model for subsidiaries, and to exclude subsidiary names  from the main regression.  Value-at-risk is based on historical variance-covariance approach.  The portfolio model is under development.  Agenda for Houston Research Group members :   Once sufficient data is collected, start reviewing for potential analytic  relationships. Get weekly updates from London, and provide feedback. Plan on a trip if the work warrants it, once the agenda is fairly well drawn  out, and data is available for analysis.

Techmemos	<22049483.1075856595300.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Option hedging for EES	Eugene,  Bob and I had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday.  For an option writer, he has the obligation to deliver, so he hedges it with  the underlying by adjesting delta positions.  The hedging cost, theoretically, should be equal to the fair value of the option premium.   On the other hand, for the option holder, he has no obligation, by delta  heging, he would pay double for the option, with no upside.  So he should not hedge  it at all.  If the option holder wants to protect the time value of the option, he should  sell  the option to the market or some equivalent options to create a theta-neutral  portfolio. This may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option  underlyings.    Our question to you, if the call options you mentioned are embedded in the  EES  contracts, say fixed price sale contracts, What makes it possible to just  separate those options and sell them to the market to retain the full values of the options ?  We  conjecture that these  options are meant to hedge the original contract. By selling those options  you eliminate the upside of the  original contract.  Give one of us a call if you want to discuss this further.

Please note that:  As Phase II comes on line, Blocks B and C will first have to run on naphtha  for a period of 3-6 months This will hit us some time in 2001, hence is a more urgent issue than LNG,  which is still a year away If there are delays in the commissioning of the Regas terminal, the period on  naphtha could further prolong The naphtha market is more volatile than the crude market, and is not as  deep, hence we need to take small positions early on to test the market DPC Board has already approved a Risk Management Policy that allows for  hedging.  We may need to look into options that are costless (selling put and  buying call) to begin with, and test while only Block A is in place. Close coordination will be required on this with the Global Markets group,  and I propose someone like Anshuman should actually be seconded onto the group A whole plan on tools to manage the fuel risk need to be worked in close  coordination with the team on the ground  These are just some of my thoughts.  With 50% of the tariff being fuel price  dependent, this is an area that requires close attention.

I was not  able to download my messages in time for the calls, but I will be on going  forward.  While I am still on vacation, I have been in conversation with Vince and the  Research Group following up on the Henwood study we had spoken about.  We  have received a formal proposal from Henwood, and they are wanting  authorization to go forward.  The study will get us the despatch forecasts  for the next 8-10 years, and will deliver the results by January end, per  Henwood.  Vince and I have reviewed the proposal, and feel that we should proceed.  We  will be fine tuning the assignment as we go forward.  The big issue there is  the data for the model/s, and at this point Henwood is relying more on us to  provide the data.  We spoke to Henwood yesterday, and I will be on another  call with them on Friday.  I need your confirmation on the following:  That I have your approval to proceed ahead with the study  That the study shall be paid for by DPC, and if so, is it OK for me to sign  the authorization being sent by Henwood We will need a formal confidentiality agreement to be in place by tomorrow  (Jim - if you have a particular format, please let me know) I am leaving the issue of hourly rates and cost to the Research group since  they have more experience in dealing with groups like Henwood.  They feel the  costs are reasonable, and I will leave it at that.  We will need to collect data from the different sources we have in India, and  I have proposed that there be a formal session in India between Henwood and  the ENE team in India in the week between 10th and 15th.  This is important  to insure that there are no disconnects, and that there are no illusions on  the quality of the data that will be available.  It will also help us  formalize the scope and better define the issues.  In order to meet the  deadlines, the data will have to be in place by January 15th.  I will call Jim later today (I had called but you were on a call).  I am here  till the weekend when I leave for India.  Please let me know if this  arrangement is OK.  Regards, Sandeep.

Techmemos	<4780716.1075856595255.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Henwood Stuff and Thoughts about Valuation	Did you guys get this?  I was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about risk/return & valuation of assets for utilities.  I thought I would mention to you, however, that when decisions are quantified, utilities usually use classical decision analysis, i.e., von Neuman utility curves.  If the decision is for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly, it is the Presidents curve; if the decision would be covered in rates, it is the customers curves or equivalently the PUCs curve.  I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where the assumptions of Black/Scholes do not apply, I would start with the CAPM for large industries in an area, use pro formas to translate this to utility curves for the input commodities, and add the utility curves.  Another issue:  The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is its role in the market.  In the 1930s, Keynes argued that if most market participants with long position were hedgers, futures prices would be higher than spot; if they were speculators or traders, future prices would be lower than spot.  Traders must be compensated for holding the risk; hedgers (including utilities and consumers) are willing to pay a premium for the certainty.  Consequently, Enron traders have bigger bid/ask spreads and lower bid prices.

Projects	<12833280.1075856589651.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Dhabol	Jeff,  We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the  numbers you have  requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in India published by The Financial Times.   The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting  millions of people. One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due  to  power shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230  million people.  The second article is Enron specific.  Vince                                            ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India                       Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001                      By ANGUS DONALD                       Tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern India                      yesterday after a power grid breakdown.                        Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the                      capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply  expected to be restored                      by the end of the day, according to power grid  officials.                        The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry  (Assocham), a                      leading business organisation, expressed deep concern  and called for a                      mechanism to prevent future disruption that could  cripple the economy.                        The power failure across eight Indian states, including  New Delhi, disrupted                      train services, water supplies and the telephone network  and forced                      hospitals to switch to emergency generators.                        The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides  electricity for 226m                      people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana,  Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,                      Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu  and Kashmir.                        A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh,  Indias most                      populous state, caused an overload of power on other  lines, which then                      failed as well.                        Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were                      damaged. New Delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before                      its own power supply could be engaged.                        We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is  most likely to be a                      technical failure, but we will investigate why it  happened, Suresh Prabhu,                      the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust  of India.                        India suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to                      upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big  problem. Thirty per                      cent of the countrys electricity is stolen, according  to analysts. In New                      Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen.                        Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh  and Delhi for                      hours.                        Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing  industrial demand                      would exacerbate the problems already faced by Indias  inefficient power                      sector. The slow progress, particularly in  strengthening the transmission                      and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will  contribute to                      worsening the power supply situation further.

Its myth and reality offensive in local newspapers  follows the west Indian                      state of Maharashtras decision to review the tariff it  pays the Texas-based                      company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating  plant at Dabhol is                      Indias biggest single foreign investment.                        Maharashtras tariff has more than doubled since 1993  and is three times                      greater than that charged by other independent power  producers (IPPs).                      The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the                      dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel. The state also pays                      a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month,  reflecting the                      huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of  consumption.                        A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that                      damaged Indias appeal to foreign investors. A former  official of the World                      Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is  emerging as the East                      India Company of the 21st century - a reference to the  British trader that                      colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th  century.                        The stand-off is the latest blot on Indias power  sector. The UKs PowerGen                      and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently,  frustrated by long approval                      procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher                      returns elsewhere.                        India has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six                      percentage points, says Gerry Grove-White, former India  general manager                      of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat  to China Light &                      Power of Hong Kong.                        Indias national plan for the five years to 2002 says  generating capacity                      must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since  1992, IPPs have                      added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under  construction. This is                      insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8  per cent economic                      growth.                        Enron was a bellwether of Indias liberalisation,  winning fast-track project                      approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant  fuelled by expensive                      naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a  Dollars 1.87bn plant                      of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas (LNG),                      will be completed this year. Only two of seven other  fast-track proposals                      have achieved financial closure.                        From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating  in Maharashtras                      then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating                      terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister  of the successor                      government, says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable.                        Enron, whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists, wants to maintain                      good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment. Enron views                      India as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of                      power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities,  such as energy, gas                      and bandwidth.                        To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy  between power                      surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed  this year. It is building                      an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas. And it is                      laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country                      desperately short of this new economy commodity.                        In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight  contract. It is supported by                      many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor                      perception of Maharashtra, Indias financial and  industrial hub, as an                      unreliable destination for investment.                        Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his  predecessor, which                      threatened to dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea - is  under pressure from                      radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options  are limited.                      Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state                      that would have to compensate shareholders.                        Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility  and Enrons main                      client, is obliged to dispatch or off-take 90 per cent  of Dabhols output. Yet                      MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take  has averaged 60                      per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has  been paying a lot                      more while consuming a lot less power.                        One reason off-take is low is because the states tough  new regulator has                      told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the  tariff would be                      Rs4.02/kWh if MSEBs off-take averaged 90 per cent. But  with off-take a                      third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and  often higher. In                      October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take  was about 49 per                      cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2,  run on cheaper                      LNG, starts.                        These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only  half of a 30 per                      cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the  balance and                      mandated bankers to find a buyer.                        Enrons difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs,  which have failed to                      deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared  they would never be                      paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt                      management of power.                        Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic  pricing means                      industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as  transmission and                      distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and  technical losses, is                      overdue. Given the limited resources, money would be  better spent on T&D                      rather than on new plant, says Oliver Blackaby,  managing director of N M                      Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the  privatisation of its                      distribution network.                        For the moment, attention is fixed on Enrons ability to  satisfy the                      competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay  Bhatnagar, chief                      executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade  magazine, one of the                      key lessons learned from phase 2 is having flexibility  to deal with                      externalities.

Projects	<9656335.1075856589556.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: The consultants model for Gary Hickersons group	The model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of power plants of Gencos. It is to give trader a better insight as to whether  the market is overvaluing/undervaluing certain Genco stocks, and trader can act accordingly.  Im still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use  it.   Modeling details: The model takes in all Gencos locational power forward prices and fuel  forward prices, and uses GARCH model to simulate one year daily prices, and then uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices.  GARCH model  parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and  are updated twice a year, and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in January or September.   Using these prices, it will determine whether a unit at a particular location  will be dispatched or not depending on A) spread of power and fuel prices, and B) whether the  start-up cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours.  The unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels. Fixed O&M, SOX and NOX (I dont know what the last  two stand for) are taken into consideration.   With the simulated dispatch schedule, the model calculates the value that can  be generated by this unit, then sums it up across all units.  The final value is the average of 100 simulations.  And it takes about 16  hours to run for about 200 units.    After our conversation, the consultant promised to look into A) how to make  the model more flexible, say, to allow a different time horizon, B) reduce spreadsheet overhead by  doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information (as of now it  saves everything  on the spreadsheet).  Assuming the GARCH process is modelled correctly, I believe the methodology  is OK, though  it does not capture most of  the optionality.   My concerns are: Whether the price processes are modelled correctly. I have to get more  details before making any conclusion.  100 simulations are way too few. Unless we convert the algorithm to C, I  dont see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations. I guess thats why they contact us. But again,  if Enrons buying the model from the consulting company, why should Enron do their job for them?  How traders going to use the model output. For this I phoned Jeff (the  associate who initiated all these) and am still waiting for his returning call.  A related questions why  the model horizon is one year.   We can either Oversee the conversation, but not doing actual coding for them. Or Redo the model for them. (The problem still remains that how traders going  to use the output).  But  in view of the Great Wall of China separating the business units, should we  do it?  As of now I have a simulation model taking start-up cost, fixed O&M, rump-up  delay into consideration.   It simulates monthly prices (using GBM) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run  10,000 simulations for  one unit for ten years (120 time steps).  It can use forward-forward vol and  incorporate seasonality into it (I understand this is debatable). (One interesting observation is that  when using forward-forward vol simulation, the standard deviation is about 0.5%, while standard deviation  using forward vol is about  2%. Also, incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1.6%). Since  most of the time-cost  occurs in price simulation, and we are to simulate about 20 price processes,   I hope the full model  (if we build it) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units. The main  task will be interfacing, i.e.,  getting data from data base, and outputting the results. This is where I need  most help if I am to do it.  Please advice the course of action. I am supposed to talk to Michelle  Cisneros today.  p.s. I never promised to oversee a programmer in our group (see the message  below).

Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by  AAs Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who  led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover  gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study  itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.   Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the  questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very  useful.    I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for  passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the  person that has contacted you.

The differences in the markets between East and West are, in  Tims opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated  as the one we are pursuing for ERCOT.  In particular, the termal limits for  which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the West.  Loop  flows are also not considered a major issue at present.  In summary, it seems that the West is an unlikely customer of any extension  to an ERCOT/East transmission model for the time being.  They have also done  little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.

The total value refers to the total present value of the storage capacity at  given status (initial conditions).  The way I calculate the unit value is   (Total PV - S*capacity taken)/total capacity  which could suffer some negative numbers since S, the spot price could be very high.  The correct way is to define the S as the average injection gas  price, but  this would be troublesome to compute.  By switching to total PV, the delta can be interpreted as total commodity  delta for the hedge.  Actually, Duffie also suggested using the total PV as the output in  his audit review.

The treasury rate at 12/28/00 was 5.127% (research uses 4.6% which probably  takes into account the recent Fed 50 bp cut) The maturity is 6/30/03 or 2.5 years (research uses 3 years)  Using these assumptions and a 47.2% volatility in the Bloomberg collar  function results in a ceiling of 92 103/256 and a floor of 34 7/8.  After  adjusting the research model for the changes above, Ryan and I got a similar  range from the research model so we are comfortable with these numbers.  Let me know if there are any questions.

The strike drops  slightly.  The volatility in the calculation is the expected future  vol;atility - looking at traded options for HC and an expected fall off in  vol for long dated options, one could justify a vol estimate in the range 40  - 50% for the collar.

Projects	<4578378.1075856588925.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Progress	Steve,  Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the  code.  Regarding Tanyas attitude. Just a few points.   1. I dont think she has the skills to do the system administrators work and she does not have the necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help.  Its not that the work is beneath her.  2. Some members of Tanyas team came to me complaining about Winston. He effectively told them to go away and work on the research projects and that he would take care of the IT issues. I dont think that its just  Tanyas issue, though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.  3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on  Tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.  The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens. Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail.  Vince     From: Stephen Stock/ENRON@enronXgate on 01/11/2001 08:23 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Progress   Vince,  I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking  about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular  distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of  multiple languages etc....  Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous  occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?  The multi-language issue isnt really that much of an issue, as the current  system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main  development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved  and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but Ive had  a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation  to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something  they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I  believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical  people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively  meaningless metric like portability.  On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted  by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei  is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working  with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to  find a common Valuation piece between the systems.  Id like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some  time over the next few days?  Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our  discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to  all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e.  Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.  She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could  get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would  measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by  inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling  tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping  through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that  studying documentation wasnt enough.   About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to  psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon.  (in fact Ive asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and  Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT working together document,  which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.  Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do  all the environment setup for her, because she doesnt really want to have to  do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT  guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as  it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is  claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she  continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and  doesnt seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could  be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and  an IT issue and ask for help from research.  I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.  I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together  over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their  progress on Friday.   In the meantime lll be looking at setting up a working test environment that  doesnt involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer  term solution.

Projects	<17933082.1075856588880.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: CA for Henwood engagement	Stinson,  Attached please find a draft Consulting Agreement for use with Henwood.    You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section  6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and  Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if  that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K.  law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law,  would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so  I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).  I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwoods proposal, and  believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in  their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the Business Conduct and  Drug Policy language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement  allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.   Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost  plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

The model assumes that if  there are positive spreads of energy products between pairs of locations, we can always find the possibilities of  swaptions. This assumption, as  discussed with Jim and Sean, is a reasonable approximation. I suggest that  the prototype be built up at this model if you think that it is rational.

Projects	<32383579.1075856588857.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	India Database	Jim/Wade,  As you are aware, I have been working with Vinces group on the Henwood model  data.  The target was to have data on all India plants collected by Jan. 15th.  We all know that getting power out o Maharashtra holds the key to being able  to solve the Dabhol challenge.  With all of your help, this model can become  the tool that tells us exactly how that can be done, and at what prices.  We are a substantial part of the way there on data collection, and have got  data of some 1500 plants across the country.  The spreadsheet for the same is  attached.  This will help you answer any questions that come up in calls  about the various plants.  Please note that we are located in the Western  Region, or WR in the spreadsheet.  We will be further scrubbing the data and  getting more recent and accurate information, especially on Maharashtra over  the next 2-3 days.    The Henwood team will be in India on Sunday, and will compare notes with the  team here.  I am arranging for a presentation on the model and what it will  do.    Wade - It would be good if a broad section of the team attend, including  Neil, yourself and Mohan.  I will talk to you about a convenient time for you  in this regard.  Neil & Mohan - Over the next week (Monday and Tuesday) I will need some time  from Vivek, Anshuman, Ravi, and a few others, to interact with the Henwood  team.  I will be abliged if you can make that possible.  The first phase of model runs (which will be done by Jan. end) will just give  us some more basic information, but I will need all of your inputs in order  to ask the right questions.  The idea is that as we go along, this model will  be used to answer all types of management questions concerning Dabhol, and  power evacuation out of Maharashtra.  This will be critical for the team going forward.  Regards, Sandeep.

Stinson - Could you please tell me what time would be a good one for you all  to hae a confernce call, but not earlier than Monday evening, India time  (Monday morning Houston time).  Please jot me a note on what would be a good  time for the call.  I will work out an agenda for the call.  Primarily, it will be discussion of  the data and on what runs we should do to begin with.  Another key part of this will be the Rate Case that MSEB is filing, because  this will determine what wil be MSEBs paymet capability in 2001/02.  This is  critical for us.

Regards, Sandeep.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Sandeep Kohli/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on  01/15/2001 01:17 AM ---------------------------   Sandeep Kohli 01/15/2001 01:17 AM To: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc:   Subject: Points for Singh Meet  Wade,  Please find below a brief note on what I feel your tack should be with  N.K.Singh (who is supposed to be a hard negotiator).  I am assuming here that  this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out  the other.  The two meetings I had arranged over the weekend, would  hopefully, have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two  people o the issue.  Incidentally, in the Indian system, the Governor of any state is a Central  government nominee.  He is the eyes and ears of the Central govt. in the  state.  Please see Basaks meeting in that light.  The message he takes will  likely go directly to the PMO in Delhi.  I will therefore be working closely  to convey the right impression.  For N.K.Singh clearly there are three things you would try to convey: A description of the problem,  Some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough, and Conveying the fact that there are win-win solutions well within the GoIs  power to implement, that would in fact enhance his reputation and the  countrys as one that lives up to its reputation  I would be careful to make the point that we are NOT going to give up any  value, but are willing to be accomodative to MSEB, GoM, and GoI needs, either  through financial re-engineering, or through getting direct access to the  market in some areas.  This will also fly well with Enron management that is  more comfortable with market risks than political.  Describing the Problem  DPC has a PPA, backed by GoI & GoM guarantees for one of the most high  profile projects in the world  (Worlds largest gas fired power plant, Indias first LNG terminal, gateway  to providing clean reliable energy for all of western India, development of  Konkan) With coming of Phase II (due end-2001) cost of power from Dabhol will be more  competitive than any other liquid fuel fired plant  (low heat rates, larger turbines, spreading of infrastructure costs over a  larger base, use of LNG as fuel) (Our average tariff at 90% despatch is Rs. 4.02/kWh for Phase I.  This goes  down to Rs. 3.30 - 3.70/kWh with coming in of Phase II.  Compare this with  NTPCs own Kayamkulam plant having a tariff of Rs.3.32 - 4.01for same range  of crude prices ($21-28/barrel).  Hence DPC power is competitive, our  standards of performance are higher, penalties for non-performance are  greater, and as a private player, our place in the waterfall seems to be  lower (quote the fact that while we have been delayed in payment by 45-60  days, MSEB has made all of its other payment commitments). However, monthly outflows could be as much as Rs. 450 Cr./month; MSEBs  monthy collections not improving - are in the range of Rs. 900 Cr./month   MSEB, and GoM clearly do not have the resources, in the short run (3-5 yrs.)  to meet these obligations; hence Central intervention is needed. In a grid of 13000 MW (Maharashtra grid size), absorbing an additional 1440  MW (Phase II) at one go is difficult; however if we take Western Region, grid  size is 42000 MW.  Clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much  easier.   To this if we add Northern and Southern grids, we can probably evacuate out  another 500-700 MW through the interconnects.  Hence, there is definitely  value in looking at this issue at a national level. Additionally, it is not just solvable at that level, but actually answers to  the crying need for power in the country, and hence is a boon for the govt.,  and should be treated as such.  Consequences of Not Solving the Problem We can call upon the sovereign guarantee, which will cover our partial  payments.  However, this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of  the countrys credit rating - put back incoming investments into the  Petroleum sector (where private participation program is about to be unveiled  in 25 O&G blocks), telecom sector (where a new policy has been announced  months ago, and where foreign companies are looking favorably at investing). It is likely to put India on the backlist of many international banks,  including export credit agencies of US, Japan, and Belgium (an EEC member). It would bring to the knees many prominent Indian banks (Indian lenders to  the project include IDBI, ICICI, SBI, to metion just a few) Would completely stop any new investment into the power sector, where there  is urgent need for funding (especially te new initiatives in transmission) There is a timeline for solving this, since our project is coming before  year-end 2001, and hence we cannot wait for the slow pace of reform to take  place at the SEB and state level.   Win-Win Solutions Exist Northern region is power starved, south needs power badly.  Hence it is a  boon to have this power made available in the timeframe.  With Central govt.  intevention, it is possible to solve th problem to everyones mutual benefit. 1440 MW (incremental Phase II) is only 3.4% of the capacity existing in the  Western Region, and can be easily absorbed. Win-Win Solutions exist by: Restructuring some of the guarantees Adding some central govt entity (including those from the petroleum sector -  IOC or GAIL, interested due to LNG trml.) to the equity mix at par Back-ending tariff and other financial re-engineering solutions that could  involve Indian banks taking a greater share of the debt. et. etc.  Bottom Line:  Time is of essence; we need to get someone to negotiate with.  Please use  your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes  Central, State govt., and SEB representatives so that we can work on the  solution. Without active participation from PMs office, we are likely to waste  precious time bouncing between the SEB, GoM, and various Ministries of GoI.  Hope this helps.  Regards, Sandeep.

Hope that you are doing well and let us  know if you require any additional information.  RJ ---------------------- Forwarded by Robert Johnston/HOU/ECT on 01/16/2001  08:08 AM ---------------------------   Robert Johnston 01/15/2001 09:10 PM To: Michelle D Cisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard  Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Jaime Gualy/NA/Enron@Enron, John Greene/LON/ECT@ECT,  Jeff Kinneman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kristin Walsh/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott  Tholan/Corp/Enron@Enron  Subject: California Power 1/15/01  As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on  for the California electricity crisis, state officials around Governor Gray  Davis have   toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed  they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be  paid by the   State of California. One problem on that front is still how much producers  want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and  his aides   want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want  about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best  way to   determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market  approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term  contracts.  Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the  view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term  power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the  utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This weeks legislative  activities in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing  purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to  finance power  purchases after utility bankruptcy.  1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships  California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment  front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that  half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to  themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations  This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both  the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a  holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E  and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices  was bought from themselves.     But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that  Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part  of any  potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to  use state credit to eliminate the risky debt premium that PG&E  and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and  that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase  utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In  return he is demanding that the companies prepare to share the  burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension.  2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money   Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back  debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up during a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by  all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis idea, as he laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize  the debts and sell them against the utilities forward rate base or by  establishing a medium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees.    In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without  direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to paydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the  $50-$55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can  pay down this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state  guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remains opposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton  administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much  flexibility.  3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation    Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury  and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political   advisers have with non-market solutions to the energy crisis. Although  the Governors aides actually believe the weapon is more a way to force  eventual   agreement, than an actual solution, the talk returns frequently to these  non-market mechanisms. We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by  the   Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will  turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and  we will re-take   the plants and equipment and run them ourselves, a close political aide to  Davis said. We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the  reserved parking   places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second.

You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section  6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and  Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if  that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K.  law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law,  would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so  I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).  I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwoods proposal, and  believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in  their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the Business Conduct and  Drug Policy language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement  allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.   Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost  plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Most state electricity boards are bankrupt . MSEB reportedly owes central=  utilities Rs 5,000 crore. They cannot bring themselves to charge many types=  of users for the power consumed, nor can they prevent large-scale theft of=  electricity. Few, including wealthy Maharashtra, have the will to reform state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution. Given=  this profile of buyers, private generators demand sovereign guarantees to=  help them tide over default risks. But the guarantees merely insulate IPPs=  against risk. They cannot make SEBs solvent. Yet, India needs power desperately. Maharashtra, India=01,s richest state, experiences power short= ages of around 2,000 MW, about a sixth of its peak needs.  Over time, the hunger for power will only grow. India cannot afford to wait=  for the painful politics of SEB reform to work themselves out. The governme= nt should bring in legislation that allows IPPs to sell power directly to payi= ng customers.This will free IPPs from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyer= s. The power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for=  the government too.Once IPPs are freed from their onerous obligations to se= ll power to single, mostly bankrupt buyers, their default risks will come down=  substantially. New Delhi and state governments should then scrap the guarantees that they gave IPPs in the past. The combination of power trading, private investments in generation, transmission and distribution, and gradual SEB reform  will create a commercial, workable and competitive power market in India. Anything less=  will be a recipe for disaster.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------   State not to give tax sops to DPC for buying naphtha from IOC, (Sanjay Jog)=   Thursday Jan 18 2001  The Maharshtra governments finance department, which is striving to reduce=  fiscal deficit from Rs 9,484 crore to Rs 3,484 crore by the beginning of April this year, has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver = to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on the procurement of 1.2 million tonne of=  naphtha from the state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).  Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express on Wednesday that DPC would=  have to pay 4 per cent sales tax. The government, way back in 1995, has modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of napht= ha from Gujarat by electrical companies operating in Maharashtra. The decision=  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphth= a at reduced rates within the state, government sources added. Sources said=  that these companies had to pay nearly 15.3 per cent sales tax on naphtha=  that was procured from Gujarat. However, following their representation, th= e government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent.  The state finance departments opinion, which would be presented before the=  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision, deserves special=  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss-makin= g Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) have wholeheartedly supported th= e DPCs cause and recommended the sales tax waiver. DPC, which was asked by t= he Union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country i= n view of excess availability, in its presentation to the state government an= d to MSEB, had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to=  pass on the additional burden on the MSEB which would be ultimately passed = on to its consumers. DPC had also told the state government that it had not pa= id sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from Glencore in the calender year=  2000.  Sources from the state energy department and MSEB have stressed on the need=  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burde= n. They have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales t= ax exemption to DPC because the IOC, at the behest of the Centre, has tried to=  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed=  memorandum of agreement with DPC. If the state finance department sticks t= o its views, it may hurt the state as a whole, sources from the state energy=  department and MSEB said.DPC will procure naphtha at Rs 11,050 per ton from=  IOC during the calender year 2001 as compared to the Rs 10,050 per tonne price quoted by Glencore. The naphtha price comprises $175 per tonne free o= n board (FOB), 21.8 per cent of customs duty, 5.4 per cent of sales tax and=  $18.87 of premium.  DPC senior vice president Mukesh Tyagi reiterated that the company has already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on=  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers. Sales tax is a pass throu= gh and MSEB, which will have to bear the additional burden, will pass it on th= e consumers, he added. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------= --- -------   Centre yet to receive proposal on Enron Thursday Jan 18 2001  CENTRE on Wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from Maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the Enron promoted Dhabol Power Project relating to cost and surplus power. Asked abo= ut the reports that Maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre=  buy surplus power from Dhabol Power Company through power trading corporation, power minister Suresh Prabhu said we have not received any proposal. We are carefully watching the situation and will await a concre= te proposal before intervening in this matter, Parbhu said on the sidelines o= f greentech environment excellence awards ceremony, here. Asked whether there=  was any possibility of the government asking the Power Trading Corporation = to buy power from the Dhabol Power Corporation, Prabhu replied what will the=  PTC do with the power?  Prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before approaching the centre for payment of dues. MSEB had earlier declined to pi= ck up its 15 per cent stake in phase II of the 1444 mw project. The Enron issu= e has been hanging fire with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board unable t= o clear the dues of DPC as a result of the skyrocketing prices of Naphtha infact MSEB has asked DPC to backdown completely leading to a situation whe= re DPC has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the month.State government has stepped in with support to the tune of Rs 114 crore to enable MSEB to clear the dues for October. MSEB dues to DPC for November and December amount to over Rs 300 crores.	Sandeep Kohli sandeep.kohli@enron.com	enron.com			2001-01-19T17:12:00+00:00

One suggestion I have is to emphasize what we can  deliver by end of January since that was the initial deadline.  Although the  memo indicates that a lot of work has been done, the reader might want to  know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results.   You will of course describe everything in your presentation, but given that  setting up presentations may take time, you should think about creating some  template/model and send it with brief explanations.  For example, a template  for TRS as it stands, and a template listing trigger events and how the  results will be displayed.  You can then expand on this in your presentations.

We need to sign this asap so as to not be in violation of ENE policies.  As you will see, the draft Agreement is made out with Enron in mind, even  though we have left the company name blank in the agreement.  Mohan - Last when we spoke (Friday), you were going to explore the tax  aspects of having DPC be the signing company.  Please tell us if that works.  Separately, you and Wade may need to consider how DPC lenders may look upon  some of the information emerging from this study, and whether you want all of  it in lender domain.  Based on the same you may want to decide whether this needs to be EIPL, ENE  Houston, or DPC.  We could also have a version where ENE Houston is signing  the contract on behalf of DPC.  Please let me know what you decide, and we will proceed accordingly.  If you  would like someone in EIPL/DPC to be signing the contract, please let me  know, who the signing authority is.  I suspect, that even I could sign on  behalf of DPC or ENE ??  If so, I will be in Houston on Wednesday, and sign  at the time.  If not, you can assign someone to sign.

Techmemos	<32364449.1075856595043.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update 1/22/01	Executive Summary Discussions continue today over bill AB1X, focus will be on price and term. New legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the  utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities hydro assets in  exchange for rate increases. Wednesday, state receives bids from auction, rate ranges are expected to be  between 5.5 and 8.0 cents per kilowatt hour. Mid week, audit  findings will be released; audit expected to show PG&Es  utility subsidiary handed over $5B to the holding company. The holding  company used $4.4B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock. State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible  bankruptcy scenario.  Bankruptcy still very possible for both        companies. Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue  solutions or bail out.  Legislation There will be continued discussion regarding bill AB1X in the Senate today.   The discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour as  well as the term.  Assemblyman Keeley, the author, indicated that he believed  5.5 cents was a fantasy and impossible to obtain.   Today, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred  Keeley, D-Boulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both PG&E and Edisions hydroelectric  facilities or transmission lines (or both) in exchange for keeping the  utilities out of  bankruptcy.  The state would allow PG&E and Edison to impose rate increases,  however, the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this  month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge.  The money collected from  consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state  would then enter into long-term contracts with power generators.  Under the  bill, the state of California would control 10% of all Californias  electricity.  As you  can imagine, this legislation has not received unanimous praise.  According  to recent corporate filings, PG&Es hydroelectric plants alone would be  valued  between $3 and $5 billion.  This amount just happens to be what Davis  estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee  once  the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is  escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $12 billion in debt.   Davis  is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help  with about $4 billion in debt, while the utilities, of course, say the full  $12 billion should  be covered.   On Wednesday, state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy  suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their  effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come.  Davis  insists there are already several bids for his 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour  ceiling, though few  agree with his opinion.  A handful of smaller, independent electricity  providers with about a 30% share of California power market, indicated Sunday  night they would come down to less than eight cents or less than half of  what they currently charge, in return for the stability of long term  contracts.  Because  consumers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current  PUC rules, any hope California has to work off the back debts for these  utilities lies  in hitting something very close to Davis price cap, without falling back on  higher prices for consumers.  The level of bids will be particularly  important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on  Friday, worried that there was no obvious long-term repayment plan for the  billions of  dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state.  Utilitys Audit By the middle of this week, California auditors will release their findings  about how much money PG&E and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions  outside their own holding company structure. This will define the limits of  what the state will guarantee, if they guarantee any of the debt. The truly  explosive  part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of  dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years.  A   source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last  three years, PG&Es utility subsidiary handed over about $5 billion to the  holding  company. Of that total, the holding company used $4.4 billion to pay  shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock.   Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current  power crisis when regulators, at the time of deregulation (under the  direction of  Former R-Gov. Pete Wilson), forced the two utilities to sell at least half of  their power-generating plants.  Auditors are expected to say that if the  utilities  still owned all these plants, electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt  hour, compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in December and January.  Bankruptcy The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities.  Senior  advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility  companies that  ended in bankruptcy.  As all the parties involved hunker down for another  intensely political week, they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy, but  to push  this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an  advantage.  Under such conditions, the risks of one or more of the players  fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy, is still quite high.    Californias political leaders order a series of independent analyses to  determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy, the state or the two  utilities. The short answer was that no one has any idea.  Below are the findings of the  report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge:  1) Would the companies be eligible for Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy?  Some of the advisors thought that PG&E and Edisons finances were so  bad that Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option.   Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate  debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the  companies into full liquidation.   This would most certainly be guaranteed  chaos. 2) Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of  electricity to consumers? The legal basis for passing on rate increases to  consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought, particularly if there  is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies.   And  there is still the  question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge. 3) If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets  seriously and finds that PG&E and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity,  he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages. 4) If the utilities go into bankruptcy, the first creditors in line would be  the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges.  The state could become  almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier   (one of the reasons why suppliers wont sell electricity on credit to these  companies now). 5) If the two companies went bankrupt, it would be the largest bankruptcies  in history, straining just about everyone involved in the process. 6) The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets  from the utility by the FERC for PG&E and already in place for Edison  may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies  currently think. This is particularly true if this weeks audit shows the two  corporations transferring  billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder  dividend payments.  Davis Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his  job, and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits.  One of Davis  concerns is, according to a senior official in the Governors office, that a  deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so  anti-utility and  anti-business that it cripples future growth in the state.  According to a  senior official, No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax  initiative would  succeed in destroying our education system, but he did, with one just ballot  line and a lot of popular revulsion. The threat of direct, popular action is at least as large now as then.  Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is  already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that  individual  electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay  their debt through higher rate-payer bills.  This official goes on to say,  The  anger at utility companies is so high here, that almost anything Rosenfield  could think of would pass and we couldnt do anything about it.  This threat  has  begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always  appeared wide open to political leaders -- floating a bond issue or a  guarantee  for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure,  and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next  several years.

The ISO combines the curves from participating SCs (of which I believe Enron is one) and calculates the uncongested and congested prices.  The CalISO prices are available from RDI PowerDat, the Enron LIM database, and a number of other sources.  Recent historical prices are available from the CalISO web site.

Techmemos	<29497531.1075856594990.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update 1/31/01	Please do not hesitate to contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh  (x39510) with additional questions.  Executive Summary An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long-term contracts (price and term). The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan  to 1) pass on court ordered rate increases and 2) issue revenue bonds. Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies.  Davis is expected to use the threat of endless  appeals in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt, as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes. Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy. Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups.  If there is a  ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected court-ordered rate  hikes, it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state.  Legislation and Bail Out Bill AB1X was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations  yesterday.  Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates.  However, the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups.   The bill  is expected to pass sometime today.  Tim Gage, CA Director of Finance said  Davis supports all the provisions in AB1X and expected to sign.    Bill AB18X was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today.  In committee hearings Monday, the DWR testified it is spent all of  the $400M and were spending $45M/day in the spot market to buy power.  According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis, the on-going court  battle, as discussed below, is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement.  Davis recognizes that 1) the expected court ruling in the CPUC  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  California rate payers; 2) despite that ruling, the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms.  Thus, Davis believes that  California consumers cannot avoid getting  hit with higher electricity  charges, but he plans to use the threat of an appeal (and a possible ballot  initiative) to limit the amount of the rate hikes.    A plan to exempt the lowest income, smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130% of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento.  That would  still hit about one half of all consumers (since the baseline is set at 60%  of average consumption), but it is progressive in a politically important  sense.   Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when PG&E admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates.    The companys defense (they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by Californians to use less electricity.   Every time you think  theres a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves,  something like this happens, one legislator moaned.  Long-Term Contracts  A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long-term power buying  contracts Davis initiated earlier this month.  The first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive, according to officials in the talks.  We got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals.   And some not so good ones, one  official told our source.   The idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say,  you want in on this with these terms?   We think well eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy.  Bankruptcy  Because of these new dynamics, there is improved market confidence that  California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  SoCal Edison and PG&E, even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today (remember, there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb. 13).  We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los  Angeles, which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week, at  the latest.  In fact, without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis.   Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives Markets, Bush administration officials, and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control.  The threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  California Public Utilities Commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid-January.  First, the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that $2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power.  Second, it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly $5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt-issuing binge.   The audit of PG&E released late last night was even more damaging: PG&E  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis by not making deep  spending cuts, including scaling back management salaries.  The auditors  also questioned the utilitys decision to funnel some $4.7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks.   Basically, they took the money and ran, as State Senate Speaker Burton put  it yesterday.  What appears to be Governor Gray Davis grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes/taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new -- and far more damaging -- burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up.  There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law, but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms.  Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below, these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult.  Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that Davis, his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing.   A ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re-establishing full  public control over the electric utilities.  Even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period.   Thats something California cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate.   Court Battle Thus, legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PG&E are likely to win in  mid-February.  The court will most likely grant the two utilities $12.7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30%, California politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama: political cover. Davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $12.7 billion debt.  PG&E and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared.  The court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear -- when the two utilities had repaid  so-called stranded costs, they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power.   Although the utilities won this case, the Judge stayed his order until  February 14th at the state governments request.  As that deadline  approaches, an intense new negotiating round is under way.  On the one hand,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices (the courts made me do it), but on the other hand, they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40% on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300% since last year.  Utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout.  Well just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid-February then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily.  One tactic the state political officials are using, in order to force a  settlement, is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years.  One political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year, next year or perhaps  even the year after. Sure, we tell them, they will probably win in court and  get that money.  Eventually.  We are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme  Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least.  We dont think  the creditors will be quite that patient.

Attached is a chart showing historical correlations for calendar spreads  between futures contracts.   It shows correlation over four different time  horizons up to the roll of the nearest contract in each pair.   As you can  see the level is usually higher than 0.98 and often near 0.99.    If our  current book of index P+ options were re-marked at a 98% correlation, it  would result in a  reduction in M-T-M value of about $78 million according to  my estimate.

This was conveyed by  Secretary (Power) during his meeting with Wade. In normal course, the  proposal was slated to be coming up for Cabinet in next few weeks. Keeping in  view the developments of DPC invoking State Guarantee, perhaps Cabinet has  hurried it up.   The exact proposal approved was - to allow foreign equity participation  through automatic route upto 100% for trading in power sector, subject to  prevailing laws.   Irrespective of urgency of this approval to us, the best thing is that we are  getting the approval without Draft Electricity Bill, 2001 being finalised. As  most of you are aware, initially the proposal was stalled at FIPB level  pending finalisation of Electricity Bill.

Projects	<21179271.1075856587721.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Synfuel option valuation	Lenny,  I believe that you must have done your home work on the the tax credit  issue.  However, it may make sense to create some kind of reserve in case the tax credit is removed  in the future.   I am glad that you like the way we treat the tax credit, which is built into  the strike price for the digital option. With the tax credit,  it is most likely the option will be  exercised.  Paulo  Issler is the person who worked on this model initially. He will be  back this Wednesday. We can talk to him about the standard deviation he put into the model.   Zimin        Lenny Hochschild@ENRON 02/12/2001 08:15 AM To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Synfuel option valuation    Zimin,   Thanks for your e-mail.  Sorry for the late reply, I was travelling last week. Im under the impression that the with the new administration, there is a  greater chance that Section 29 will be extended beyond 2007 than repealed. If  this happens, we contractually have the right to extend this contract. We  have not valued the chance of this happening, so I dont think we should  value the chance of this not happening.  Anyways, let me speak to my supervisor on this and revert.  In the meantime, I looked over the amendment you made with regard to adding  the second strike of the tax credit and think this is now reflective of the  deal and am happy with it. I still do not understand a few things re:  where  did the St. deviations come from. I believe you said that someone who works  for you put this together but was away last week.  Please revert with his/her name so that I can get together and understand  this.  Thanks. Lenny     Zimin Lu@ECT 02/06/2001 01:09 PM To: Lenny Hochschild/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Eric Groves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: Synfuel option valuation    Lenny,  I think we had a good discussion about the deal valuation.  One thing, I think you are prefectly aware of it, is that the economics of this deal is driven by the tax credit ($25.03).  The risk on our side is that if the tax credit is removed, AIG will not deliver the synfuel   and pay $4.55 to us.    Vince mentioned that Congress might act  quickly enough to eliminate  the tax benefit.   I just want to remind you we should take this risk  into consideration.    Zimin   PS:  I changed the results in sheet1 slightly. The values in column A was shifted by 0.5.  Use the attached model.

Techmemos	<15151244.1075856594830.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	El Paso Statement on California Situation	In case you havent already seen this:  El Paso Addresses the California Energy Situation  ( February 26, 2001 )  HOUSTON, Feb. 26 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG) reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties involved to help improve Californias energy situation. We are surprised to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Pasos involvement in California, said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Corporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record.  The significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power, which has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate electricity. High natural gas prices are, therefore, an effect rather than a cause of the power shortage.  Allegations that natural gas prices were deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue. It is not possible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to cause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use that capacity. The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate found to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to serve California and other Western markets.  Allegations that there was a conspiracy in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into California are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge. The facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990s were either built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer support to justify their construction. For example, despite years of marketing efforts by Tenneco, not a single potential customer could be induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed Altamont project to proceed. For that reason alone, it was ultimately dropped. In 1996, according to estimates, there were between one and two billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of excess natural gas transportation capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California. Indeed, it was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess capacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to encourage PG&E, SoCal Edison, and SoCal Gas, beginning in 1996 and continuing into 1998, to relinquish over 1.5 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline. Processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into California, and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today.  As recently as last year, there were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands at that time. Notwithstanding its availability, this capacity was not used by shippers to California to fill in- state natural gas storage facilities for future use. If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in 2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999, reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided.  It is now widely recognized that the California energy crisis was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California to keep pace with the states economy and increased demand. A combination of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices. First, the construction of new power plants in California is a slow, difficult, and heavily regulated process. As a result, the growing demand has far outstripped in-state generating capabilities. Second, unfavorable precipitation and increased out-of-state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power normally relied on by California to become unavailable. Third, increased demand for power in the western United States drove up prices that California had to pay to out-of-state generators. Fourth, state policies deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers, leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their costs. Fifth, because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased costs to consumers, the utilities creditworthiness was impaired, causing supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and expensive to purchase. Sixth, the early and greater-than-normal use of peaking units-plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand conditions-necessitated unscheduled maintenance, rendering them unavailable at critical times. Seventh, during the final months of 2000, some power plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air emissions credits. Eighth, a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold weather further drove up demand for power. Finally, the increased power costs in California could have been substantially mitigated through long-term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short-term power market.  California is currently in a difficult position, but now has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long-term energy policy, said Dunn. El Paso has been one of the largest suppliers of energy to California for more than 50 years, and we are actively participating with all parties in California to be a part of a long-term, stable solution to Californias energy needs.  El Paso Corporation, the largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world, spans the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. With an enterprise value in excess of $50 billion, El Paso is a leader in every phase of the natural gas industry. The company owns and operates a significant portion of the North American natural gas delivery grid, operates the fastest growing, most sophisticated energy merchant group, and is the nations third largest natural gas producer. El Paso, a leader in risk management techniques, is focused on maximizing shareholder value, transforming existing markets, and speeding the development of new markets.

The dissertation hasnt been reviewed by Les or the External yet - although its been at FORC for 2 months. I think that the Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to both our companys businesses - although I ultimately didnt have the time to explicitly price the jump risk-premium which I conjectured is possibly implicit in the prices of exchange-traded electricity futures-options - rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a rough assessment (with a little bit of further work, but not too much) be made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets.  In other words, I assumed spot jump-risk to be undiversifiable, and essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to :  1) proving that a jump-diffusion trading model is incomplete (synthesising the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory) - note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with term structure securities as in the HJM w/ jumps papers of Shirakawa and Das and;  2) deriving an explicit risk-adjustment process for implementing the price of jump-risk using a jump-diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth process (ie. a jump-augmented production economy approach in the spirit of CIR, Bates, Ahn & Thompson).   Incidentally, I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done much work on real-asset valuations in a spark-spread option-valuation framework ?  Im about to start a project evaluation of embedded optionality, and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward gas / power price processes.  With the former, I can model mean-reversion and jumps explicitly (obviously, important for capturing the optionality of out-of-the-money plant, which might otherwise be ignored in a pure-diffusion framework) but am not maximising the informational content of the available market data (that is, assuming there was a long-term market forward curve for electricity); whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition means that I have to capture mean-reversion via the futures volatility function, and jumps are less easy to calibrate.  Any suggestions ?

Stanford	<18699857.1075856630781.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	possible RTP conference	Dear Mr. Kaminski:  Thank you for talking with me about a possible RTP conference.  I would like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries.  As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you.  In discussing power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the forgotten resource in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many researchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was asked whether a group like Stanfords EMF might explore this topic and give it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by policymakers.  Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major sponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron that the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate, it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the conference is widely circulated among key government groups.  I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to participate.  I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of providing funding for this effort.

Techmemos	<17172896.1075856594716.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update 3/06/01	Executive Summary ? If no comprehensive deal is reached by April 9th, chances of bankruptcy  increase due to a one day opt-out clause in all long-term power contracts.  ? PG&E and State locked in tough negotiations, several issues on the table:  PUC-imposed requirement forcing PG&E to ultimately be responsible for  California energy supplies  Price of the grid; state - 2.3 times book value vs. PG&E - 4 times book value ? PG&E will not use any of the $1B secured last week to help their ailing  utility. ? Daviss announcement of long term power contract didnt include some  details:  Of the 8,800 megawatts secured this far, only 6,000 are available this  summer   Some of the long term contracts are really only for three months  None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot  market ? One the same day Davis announced long term contracts, Davis also quietly  announce a 10% rate hike. ? FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal.   PG&E Transmissions deal One thing that is still uncertain is PG&E.  Bankruptcy may still be a likely  alternative if current negotiations to buy PG&Es share of the electric  transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April 9 (when all long-term power  contracts being negotiated have a one-day opt-out clause they can exercise  unilaterally if a comprehensive solution has not been reached by the state  and its major utilities).  According to sources close to senior PG&E  officials, PG&E made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal  on the transmission lines depends on the California governments willingness  to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make  until now.   PG&E will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to  relieve it of the PUC-imposed requirement to be the electricity buyer of  last resort.  Current state regulations make the utility companies  ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all  times to supply Californias energy needs.  As long as the state steps in and  makes those purchases, as it has for the past three months, the utilities are  shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot  market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings.   But, PG&E officials are worried 1) this summers supply and 2) Daviss  concern over how fast he is draining the states budget surplus.  If things  get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state  will pay only for the electricity it buys through long-term contracts, then  PG&E will be left holding the bag.   Thus, as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid, PG&E is  demanding a comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost  differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed  to pay.  State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of get out of  jail free card, so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough  negotiations that are complicated by three other factors: (1) PG&Es public  behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to  encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy; (2) State legislative  demands that the price Davis negotiate for PG&Es part of the electricity  grid be no more than 2.3 times revenues from the grid; and (3) the FERC must  positively approve any grid purchase by the state of California.   The principal concern on the price front is that PG&E wants to sell the  electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their  transmission, while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the  politically acceptable limit.  We see 2.3 times book value as an absolute  upper bound. There is no way PG&E will get more than that, whatever they  think, according to the leader of one main consumer groups.  We are going  to try to force any deals down to about 2.0 in any case. Negotiators for  Davis are also trying to proposition-proof any transmission deal to protect  against a later ballot proposal.  They think there are ways to do that, but  not if the price of PG&Es part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative.   Remember, if Daviss eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will  be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed  to overturn his solution.  On the Sacramento front - no one understands PG&Es motives The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game  PG&E is playing.  In a three day period PG&E made a series of announcements  that left everyone scratching their heads.  ? Late Thursday, PG&E officials leaked information to California papers that  they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity  transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then  made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30%  above what the state was currently offering.  While a deal can still be done,  anything like the $10 billion PG&E wants would be very hard to get through  the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase.  ? Late Friday, PG&E officials announced that they had secured a $1 billion  loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the  money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $161 million to  shareholders in a new dividend payout.  Not a cent of that money was  earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PG&E and that left at  least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the  utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood.  ? Over the weekend, PG&E leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay  off its energy suppliers debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now.  For  generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to  start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy  action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will  make them whole in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is  extremely unnerving.  Thus, in a very short time period, PG&Es corporate owners showed they could  access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they  were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the  energy crisis.  Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at  least a part of the $13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer  and PG&Es fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands.  As one senior  political official told our source just when you think the corporate  leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they  come up with something even more outrageous.   PG&Es actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to  construct to solve Californias problems.  State Democrats doubt they will  get Republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the  two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in 90 days  for the legislation to go into effect).  Additionally, in the past 48 hours,  many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less  in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and  may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the  electricity grid.  Long-term Contracts - Davis didnt tell the whole truth Yesterday, Davis announced that he had signed long-term power deals for  8,800 megawatts of power, out of a total 12,000 megawatts he wanted to sign  eventually. According to the press release, Davis is now 75% of the way  toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of  Californias energy crisis. This means consumers would maybe pay more than  necessary five years from now, but these contracts guaranteed that  consumers would pay less for the next three years.  What Davis failed to  highlight was that of the 8,800 megawatt commitment, actually only 6,000  megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to 45,000  megawatts); and some of these long-term contracts are actually only good  for three months.  None of these contracts, however, keep California from  having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market.  Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year While the media was concern with Daviss announcement of long term contracts  for California, of less concern to the media was Daviss quietly announced a  decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. The state will  accept the 10% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a  permanent increase as well as an additional 10% increase for consumers that  will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires.  That would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour.   FERC The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve  it in a positive vote. Senior California officials and legislators doubt that  FERC has jurisdiction, and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal. But  they may be wrong. The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs  off on the deal. Its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what  anyone says, according to source close to the President. There are three  possibilities: 1) FERC could pocket veto it by not even putting it on  agenda for discussion; 2) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted  down. The Democrat on the commission, William Massey, has already said he is  opposed to it; or 3) the Commission could approve it but with condition that  Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system.  One complicating factor in the FERC decision, however, is that its chairman  Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not  be around long enough to have his say. Hebert is definitely not a shoo in  for the FERC chairman position, says one Washington official. Two other  appointments to the Commission will soon be named, this official notes, and  one of them could easily become chairman.

Techmemos	<23050840.1075856594666.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update 3/15/01	Executive Summary ? Davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for  past utility debt ? Davis and PG&E negotiations at a standstill, sticking point is net short  for PG&E this summer  ? As the days go on with no word of a secured deal, involuntary bankruptcy  chances increase significantly among small generators and QFs ? FERC would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions  for California  California Public Utility Commission Rate Increases  Today may be the turning point as the CA PUC reviews the size of the  Department of Water Resources  (DWR) rate increase to be passed along to  consumers on their electricity bills.  Until now, Davis has considered rate  hikes to be political suicide, but there may be some relief for him from  consumer groups.   Sources indicate that one of Californias main consumer  advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption,  but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt.  DWR,  which is currently buying power on behalf of the state, needs more income to  securitize the planned $10B bond issue that is key part of Davis plan to  sign long term power contracts.  As DWR continues to spend $40 to $60 M every  day on power purchases, a well placed source informed us the DWR is  essentially bankrupt.  It currently has no money for normal activities such  as ordering supplies, purchasing new equipment, etc.  The Department of  Finance is forwarding DWR money from where ever it can (parks, other  programs) to purchase power, but DWRs hands are tied until revenue bonds are  issued.  The California State Treasurer Phil Angelides will be submitting a  recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $10  billion worth of state bonds.   Davis & PG&E at Odds  Sources report that Davis and PG&E negotiations are facing two difficult  challenges: 1) PG&E wants 2.9 times book, which is far more than consumer  groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines (SCE accepted 2.3),  and 2) PG&E needs relief from Davis for PG&Es legal responsibility to be the  ultimate power purchaser for the state, and at this point Davis wants to  limit further state energy power purchases (especially for summer).  The  utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars  further in the red ($3 to $4 B) and PG&E may declare bankruptcy for their  utility subsidiary if Davis tries to force the issue.  Additionally, Davis is  being hounded by the press and Harvey Rosenfield to publish details of the  states 40 long-term power contracts; a measure that if accomplished would  provide Davis with even less negotiating power.  With all this activity, Davis is starting to lose support in the state  legislature.  Sources report increasing tension between the Governor and  State Senate President Pro-tem John Burton.  Burton has just announced a  special Senate Committee will investigate the generators for evidence of  price manipulation, and the State Auditor is also planning an investigation.   Davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being  picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later.  QFs Most Likely Source of Involuntary Bankruptcy Sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience  and force bankruptcy on the utilities.  SB 47X may have been Californias  Qualified Facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing  against PG&E, SoCal Ed, and SDG&E.  The bill designed to cut the QFs costs  and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the States  senate.  Sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further  investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates.  Out with Hebert, In with Wood The Bush administration favors replacing Hebert, Jr. with Texas PUC head Pat  Wood.  There is an intense battle behind the scenes between Senate Republican  Leader Trent Lott , who favors Hebert, and President Bush, who wants Wood.   The administration would prefer Wood because they do not want FERC to pick a  fight with Davis which means Bush might ultimately lose some western states  in 2004.  In effort to tone down the recent press reports, Hebert has made  several token concessions to California, including $69 million worth of power  refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and  power plant installation.    Its is expected that FERC would most likely approve any transmission deal  that Davis could complete but with a list of conditions.  Some conditions  might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well  as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic Administrative actions in  the West next year.  The Bush Administration is opposed to price caps and  believes in free market solutions.  The Administration is also considering  whether it might be a good idea to privatize Federally-owned assets such as  BPA.

Techmemos	<28430901.1075856594638.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update 3/16/01	? A source within the generator community confirms press reporting that Coram  Energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week.  Through an  intermediary, we were able to corroborate this information with a senior  member of the CA ISO board.  Coram  Energy is a relatively small wind  generator QF based in West Vancouver, British  Columbia, though it also owns  wind stations in California.  Coram has 238  40 kw units.   ? The source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the   fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for Governor Davis  to  be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature.  It is  unlikely  that blackouts would happen in April or May, meaning a  long wait for the  cash strapped QFs to wait to get paid. ? The filing will be against Socal. ? In order to file an involuntary bankruptcy, Coram  would have to file along  with at least two other creditors owed $10,000 or more.  Sources report Coram  has two other creditors who will file with them (working on finding out who  they are). ? Sources also report that other QFs are taking  legal advice on how to  proceed in light of these developments.

Stanford	<7722555.1075856630581.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Stanford Associate Recruiting	I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your  participation in the Stanford Associate interviews last week.  Our efforts  resulted in 6 summer associate offers and 1 full-time associate offer.   Althea Gordon will be e-mailing you the names of the individuals who will  receive offers.  We would like you to contact these individuals to  congratulate them and encourage their acceptance.  Althea will match you up  with the candidates you interviewed and provide you with contact information.  Althea has verbally contacted both the offers and the declines.  We will be  sending out both offer letters and decline letters by end of day Tuesday,  March 20.  In the meantime, should any of you be contacted by students who  did not receive an offer, I recommend the following verbal response:  Our summer program is highly competitive, forcing us to choose a smaller  number of candidates from a highly qualified pool.  Our summer hiring this  year will be between 35-40 associates.  The full-time program typically hires  between 80-90 associates.  Given that you made it this far in our selection  process, I would strongly encourage you to apply in the fall for the  full-time associate program.  We will keep you informed via e-mail of our acceptance rate at Stanford.  Again, thank you for your support.  We look forward to working with you on  potential future Stanford recruiting events.

London	<23304264.1075856608766.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Softs in London	Vince,  With regard to the softs curves development, I have been communicating with a  couple of folks in London.  The key contacts include James Willis (cocoa and  sugar broker) and Nigel Majury (coffee broker).  We had a conference call on  Thursday (Heather, Trena, Erin, James, Nigel, Frank Speight, Nelson) to  discuss data sources, data acquisition, priorities, and timelines.  A number  of data sources were identified (e.g., USDA, Intl Cocoa Organization, ED&F  Man, Landell-Mills Commodities, etc.) and both the Houston and London offices  have taken steps to obtain the information.  Curve development priorities  were adjusted as well.  Raw sugar remains the top priority; however, cocoa  replaces coffee in the softs importance hierarchy.  I suppose that this  results from our physical (or soon to be) positions in both markets.  The  timeline hasnt changed; however, adjustments will have to be made since we  havent yet acquired all of the necessary data for price modeling.  Moreover,  per our discussion this afternoon, additional thought/time will have to be  devoted to corn modeling to come up with an adequate hedging strategy.

Projects	<29733331.1075856587432.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Changes in option valuation in Enpower	---------------------- Forwarded by Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT on 03/21/2001 08:33 AM  --------------------------- From: Harry Arora/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/21/2001 07:26 AM To: Sanjay Gupta/ENRON@enronXgate, Steve Nat/ENRON@enronXgate cc: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: Changes in option valuation in Enpower  Sanjay  Wanted to confirm the changes to the option valuations in the Enpower we  discussed yesterday evening.  1. Currently the trader volatility inputs are the daily vol curve and the  intra-monthly vol curve. The monthly options get marked directly to the  monthly curve (plus the smile) and the monthlies get marked to a time blend  of monthly and intra-month vol (plus the skew).  We want to change the valuation (for the Eastern books) so that the dailies  get marked to the intramonth curve (which we want to call the daily curve)  and the monthly gets marked to the monthly curved. There will be not vol  blending done by the Enpower system for the daily and monthly option  valuations. We want to make this change very soon (by early next week)   2. Currently there exists one smile for every region, which is specified in  terms of volatility additive  for specified dollar difference from the  underlying. Since different months in a region can trade in a large range  ($35 - $150) - this cannot result in accurate skew for all terms.  What we  need is a system which has skew per month.  We suggest, for the short term, the skew should apply only to the summer  daily expiration options. We need to make this change by early next week.  However, we need to start modifing  the system so that for every region we  can enter a grid which has a percentage scale and specifies the skew  differently for each month.  Research, has implemented this in our pricing  model, and we would like this grid to be input into the valuation system.  I  am enclosing the pricing model (which we both discussed yesterday) for  reference. This model is however, work under construction, so pls call Alex  Huang for clarifications.  3. The vol input system is complex and confusing. I would very much be interested in moving to a direct database interface,  which accomodates the skew inputs per region as in <2>. We should implement a  UI which can input the dailies and monthlies at the moneys and the skew grid  directly - so that we do not need to go through multiple iterations. I am very much interested in what we currently are releasing in Delphi and  would love an early implementation for options.  On all these issues, I am speaking for the East desk. I am going to touch  base with West guys and see if they are on board with these changes.

Projects	<16546398.1075856587409.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	EOL Project	Vince,  Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -  I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had been  accomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by the  information available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed his  interest in having a couple of reports made up that couldnt be created from  the format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has already  made changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.  I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platform  for EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I have  looked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. I  have also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site,  but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any further  suggestions would be appreciated.  I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modifications  may be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at the  websites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together a  presentation for you and/or Greg Whalley.

Your help was  invaluable .  As you may have been aware, we were performing the cluster  analysis to define the commercial zones in ERCOT.  I only had a few days in  which to learn the FASTCLUS procedure in SAS and prepare graphical views of  the results.    Your assistance ensured that Enron was seen as one of three market leaders  who had the capability to perform the analysis and cross check other market  participants analysis.  We were the only participant who had the ability to  graphically  display the results.    I was able to take the lead in a commercial meeting because of the data and  results.  I just wanted you guys to know that I really appreciated your help.  I have attached a couple of files that show some of the results.  The  presentation has the best overview.

I am suppose to know this stuff, as I teach it!  Sorry about the delayed billing. I have had trouble getting a bill from my excellent asistant, Taichi Hoshino, who has returned to Goldman Tokyo, and has not been able to get anything else done lately. I will try to get something out soon!  We had several energy people, from several companies, at our credit risk exec ed course last month. Seems that credit risk and  power risk go together these days!

Decision Information Sciences also has done much work in studying  critical  infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also  may be of  interest.

If you have some time, Id like to discuss the meeting that we had with  Comdata (which has a 60% market share of the fleet card business).  They have  some live data that potentially could be very interesting; however, Id like  to discuss it with you.  Shawn    What a Mess!(Statistical Data Included) JOHN D. SCHULZ 03/26/2001  Traffic World  Page 25  Copyright 2001 Gale Group Inc. All rights reserved. COPYRIGHT 2001 Journal of  Commerce, Inc.  Truckers still waiting for signs of pent-up freight demand; earnings  shortfalls, layoffs loom  If you are waiting for trucking to kick-start the nations economic recovery,  pull up a chair and wait awhile. Trucking CEOs say they havent seen this  slow a first quarter in a decade.  Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a  public company in 1990, Phoenix-based Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO  Jerry Moyes said.  The first-quarter trucking mantra historically has been this: everybody loses  money in January, hopes for a break-even February and earns whatever profit  there is in the quarter in March. That formula may not hold this year.  Gregory L. Quesnel, president and CEO of Con-Way Transportation Services and  Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc., said the current slowdown was first detected  late in the third quarter last year and has become more pronounced in each  successive quarter. March, he said, has been as disappointing as the first  two months this year.  Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers. Yellow Freight  System has idled as many as 1,000 Teamsters and hundreds of white-collar  back-office workers. Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls  that will cause them to miss analysts first-quarter estimates. But there are  deeper fears, too. Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy. Small,  family-owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms  because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing  some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years  ago.  Swifts volume drop-off began with shipments originating on the West Coast in  January and February and it is continuing in March, Moyes said. Coupled with  reduced demand from the Southwest, Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts  first-quarter earnings expectations. Swift is not alone.  We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago, said Bob  Hammel, executive vice president of Pittsburgh-based Pitt Ohio Express, a  leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier. The slowdown in  manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous. Nobody  anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off.  Even Con-Way, the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years, said  it would have a decline in first-quarter operating income compared with the  year-ago period. Con-Ways tonnage declines were estimated in the  mid-single-digit percentage range.  Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to  11 percent below those a year ago, which will result in an approximately  one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) decline in its operating ratio. (see  sidebar)  Pat Hanley, Overnite Transportations senior vice president and chief  financial officer, said freight figures were flat in February year over year  but rose slightly in March. Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry  with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year.  January was pretty good to us, but February was flat. Its coming back in  March. Were probably up in low single digits, 3 to 4 percent. Were picking  back up. The economy has hurt us. If you had asked us at the start of the  year, wed have said wed be up double-digits, Hanley said.  The national economic picture is a big concern, Hanley said. Were not  seeing pressure on prices, at least not so far. Were seeing customers ship  10 pallets a day instead of 20. The shipment size is coming down. Certainly  were concerned. Well do O.K., but not as great as wed like.  Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever  stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspans world. The  genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking, which  is always a first-in, first-out industry in any economic slowdown.  To hear trucking industry leaders tell it, get comfortable with beans and  franks for dinner. Its going to be awhile before its filet mignon time  again.  Shippers see whats happening as well but say its still too early in the  year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks.  All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business  levels -- definitely slower than early last year, said Bill Huie, assistant  vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp., Irving, Texas.  With a couple of exceptions, carriers we talk with have no plans for  expansion in the next few months. We are getting feelers about some possible  lane adjustments to boost revenue. But generally it appears a little early in  the economic downturn for much price movement.  The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things. Our business is down  pretty substantially for the first quarter, said Roger Dick, spokesman for  Yellow Corp., parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL  carriers, Jevic Transportation, Delanco, N.J., and Saia Motor Freight,  Duluth, Ga.  USFreightways Corp., citing what it called the nations serious economic  slowdown, said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall very substantially  below current Wall Street consensus.  Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating  environment, USF Chairman, President and CEO Samuel K. Skinner added.  Traditionally, the first quarter builds momentum slowly, with March being  the strongest month of the period, Skinner said in a statement. This year,  the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January  and February, softening even the normal modest expectations for those two  months.  Its not just the LTL industry thats hurting. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply  relationship since analyst James J. Valentine began tracking the data in  April 1994. Two events can cause weakness in the index, according to  Valentine. They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak  freight demand.  So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the  fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply, Valentine wrote  in his most recent Trucking Snapshot for early March.  Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over  year, according to Valentines index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That  would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was  masked by the strong economy, Valentine says.  In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to  plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a  reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance  for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts.  The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last  year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at  manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers. Used trucks have lost on  average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months.  Anecdotally, one used truck dealer, Music City Truck & Equipment, in  LaVergne, Tenn., is holding a two-for-one sale on three- to five-year-old  Class 8 Freightliners. You can buy two for around $30,000, less than a brand  new Chevy Suburban SUV.  What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for $70,000 and  depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the  books this year at $35,000. But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that  value, it may only be worth $24,500 in actuality. For a carrier with a  100-truck fleet, that equates to a loss of more than $1 million on assets.  The glut may last for a while, according to Valentines analysis. Assuming a  three-year trade-in cycle, most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload  sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market. That means that  overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year.  That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business, as  did nearly 1,900 carriers last year that either closed or declared  bankruptcy.  We can see from indexes, surveys and other information available to us that  it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight  demands will continue to be soft throughout the month. Based on all of these  factors, we expect USFreightways profits for the first quarter to be very  substantially less than published analysts forecasts, Skinner said.  In addition, severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle,  rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and  decreased efficiencies, Skinner added.  Expectations at each of USFs operating companies have been affected, some  more than others. The LTL, logistics, reverse logistics and  freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a  similar period last year, Skinner said.  Further job cuts at USF Worldwide, its freight forwarder, would be in the  offing as cost controls at the unit would be accelerated in the wake of the  softening economy, Skinner said. Late last year, Skinner said the rebuilding  process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process. But the worsening  economy has made that rebuilding job harder, he said.  We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is, in fact, further  impeding progress in this area, Skinner said. During the fourth quarter of  2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the company has taken  steps to increase cost efficiencies. Among these actions are a substantial  cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force.  These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance  the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions.  In the 2000 first quarter, USF posted $22.3 million net income, a 27 percent  rise from the $17.5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter. At the time,  that was USFs 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase. It came  on $608.2 million revenue, an 18.5 percent rise in from the $513.2 million  revenue in the 1999 first quarter. Analysts had been estimating USF to earn  about $3.50 a share earnings for 2001, compared with actual $3.61 earnings  per share for all of last year. In the fourth quarter last year, USF earned  $23.7 million, or 91 cents a share.

Capacity           Retail sales of Class 8 tractors (new trucks                    entering the market) came down in January, but                    inventory (trucks that will enter the market at some                     point) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3.4 months GDP                4Q00 GDP increased 1.1% and economists see U.S.                    recession in 2001 with +0.5% and -1.4% GDP forecast                     for 1Q01 and 2Q01, respectively.

While this                    was better than forecast, the upside was likely                    the result of excessive clearance sales after a                    disappointing holiday season. Consumer           The Conference Boards measure of consumer confidence         confidence fell again (nine points) in February                    after registering the largest one-month decline                    in 10 years in January (14 points). NAPM               The February NAPM rose slightly to 41.9.                    However, it still indicates a contracting                    manufacturing sector. Leading            The index of leading economic indicators economic           rose 0.8% in January, while indicator          MSDW had forecast a 0.6% increase.

Stanford	<16971611.1075856630423.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	retail markets conference	I would like to invite you to participate in a conference on Retail Participation in Competitive Power Markets to be held at Stanford University on June 21-22, 2001. Although California and other regional markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June, there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from different experiences.  This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more information about the conference by checking under Meetings on our EMF website listed below.  Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand response programs rather than on the technical details of their methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected issues.

Although California and other regional markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June, there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from different experiences.  This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more information about the conference by checking under Meetings on our EMF website listed below.  Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand response programs rather than on the technical details of their methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected issues.  Thank you, Hill Huntington   ******************************************************************* Hillard G.

As we have discussed, the volatility of the won closely  tracks fluctuation in the yen, and this yen position paper is intended to  complement the won outlook piece for a broader perspective on currencies that  takes into account the yens influence on asian currencies. .    We would like to distribute this outlook to David and Rudi, but wanted to  send it to you for initial reaction prior to internal distribution.

Projects	<24482362.1075856587210.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Generation Earnings Model	Michelle, I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked  earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts  and run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results. This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem.   In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is  optimal. I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C, but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Last week we ran Calpine using 46 days  of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations. The 100 iteration  run took 16 hours to run. To run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of  data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days. We are  concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be  increased to at least 500 iterations.   We are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful  than the test computer we have been using. Do you have any suggestions as to  how we can improve the process?

Krishnarao Vice President, Enron Corporation  Dear Dr. Krishnarao,  Professor Veinott told me a little about the research going on at Enron from his conversation with you late last week. The work sounded very interesting to me. Professor Veinott also told me that the research group at Enron may have some positions for which I might be qualified. I am writing to let you know that I would have great interest in exploring this potential opportunity with you. To that end I attach my resume together with an abstract of my Ph.D. thesis under Professor Veinott as a Word document. I might also add that I expect to finish my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering here by July 1, 2001.  Incidentally, my work has led me to study your own thesis in some detail and I have been very impressed with it. It may be of some interest to you that our work is related and seems to require a different generalization of Karushs additivity-preservation theorem than the lovely ones you develop.     I look forward to hearing from you.

As we have discussed, the volatility of the won closely tracks fluctuation in the yen, and this yen position paper is intended to complement the won outlook piece for a broader perspective on currencies that takes into account the yens influence on asian currencies. .    We would like to distribute this outlook to David and Rudi, but wanted to send it to you for initial reaction prior to internal distribution.

Projects	<22894940.1075840778055.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Generation Earnings Model	Michelle, I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked earlier about using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts and run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results. This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem.   In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is optimal. I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C, but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Last week we ran Calpine using 46 days of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations. The 100 iteration run took 16 hours to run. To run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days. We are concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be increased to at least 500 iterations.   We are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful than the test computer we have been using. Do you have any suggestions as to how we can improve the process?

Tony and I are currently trying to get a  grasp of what the traders here require in the way of weather information and  are building a support structure for them.  As such - we will need to have  close ties with the UK Met office as well as other data providers.  The  information presented today was very helpful.  Wed like to take a little time to sit down with you - and/or some of the  other participants whose markets are weather driven.  Wed like to get a feel  for what data is already streaming in - and then get an idea as to how we can  utilize and supplement that data for the Europe markets.  We have a model  created in Houston to start from - but we want to make sure to tailor to the  needs of the traders here.  Would you like to take some time to sit down and chat?

I have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in Stochastic Processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models. If we had more interview time I would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills.  He completely failed to answer the second question, which is to check his basic risk management skill. It is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management. He does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk. He showed some weakness in annuity calculation.   In conclusion, I feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance. Based on his experiences, I have a doubt on his advance optimization skills, such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem. I would recommend a second-round interview if he will be solving a complex-optimization problem.   -Chonawee	Zimin Lu <Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECT> zimin.lu@enron.com	enron.com	Vince J Kaminski <Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT> vince.kaminski@enron.com	Stinson Gibner <Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT> stinson.gibner@enron.com  Pinnamaneni Krishnarao <Pinnamaneni Krishnarao/HOU/ECT@ECT> pinnamaneni.krishnarao@enron.com	2001-04-12T01:45:00+00:00

Maybe it is from his consulting background, I found that at times he exaggerates a bit about his roles in model building. He would  start saying he did everything, and later water it down quite a bit. (What he actually did is not an easy accomplishment though.)  He also stressed that he wants to move away from pipeline  projects.  I did not got a chance to ask him any questions about derivatives and finance.

London	<18817010.1075856608585.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Weather team & Stinson Gibner	John,   I hope you had a good Easter weekend. I typically take Monday Easter off but   this year too much was going on.   Two items I wanted to mention:   1. Tony Hamilton, weather support   Tony Hamilton, a meteorologist Ph.D. hired to support Global Markets, spent  a   few weeks in Houston, in training with Mike Roberts team. He went back to   London 10 days ago and he hit the ground running. He is supporting not only   crude and weather derivatives, but also gas and power, and is inundated with   requests for help.    He is supported by another member of Mike Roberts team, Steve Bennett, on a   temporary assignment (10 days planned originally).    Action recommended.    a. Extension of Steve Bennett temporary assignment for a few more weeks. I   have already authorized extension till the 27th. I shall speak more with  Tani   on Wednesday about it. ?b. ?Hiring another weather person to work with Tony   Hamilton, supporting gas and power across continental Europe.     2. Stinson Gibner   Slava is currently in Houston, learning more about research group here and   building a network of relationships. I have a very high opinion of Salvia -   he is a very bright person, very personable and hard working. I still worry   about the depth and breadth of his experience, his understanding of the   totality of Enron business and the relative ?importance of multiple   activities we have to support. I think it makes sense to have a more   experienced research person coaching him for 18-24 months. I talked to Bryan   Seyfried and Ted Murphy and they expressed similar concerns about the depth   of support they expect.   Action recommended.   I still think it makes sense to bring Stinson Gibner to London for an   extended stay. To manage Slavas expectations, I would call Stinson a Head  of   Research for Europe and Asia. His responsibility would also include   coordination of research and model building for other locations than London   where I see a lot of activity that goes on without regular audits and ?  reviews we have in Houston, and over which we have no control (except for   reacting to requests for assistance). I propose that Stinson come to London   in the next few days to discuss the potential assignment with you.    By the way, Greg Whalley agrees with the idea of a senior research person in   London. He, however, recommended Vasant - stronger work ethics is the main   consideration.

I did not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in Enron.  As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I have been working two years as Lead Scientist and Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue Management Inc. in Houston.  I developed and implemented the mathematical models for Trading Optimization System and Firm Transportation Optimization System.  The Trading Optimization System becomes the most popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy just signed the contract to buy this product yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department, the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15 companies in one or two years.  Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my research and system developing efforts to combine revenue management with risk management. I am confident that I can make significant contributions to Enron in this area.  I would like to thank you again for giving me this opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am looking forward to having the opportunity to work in Enron.  Sincerely Yours   Jacob    --- Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com wrote: > Jacob, > > It was nice meeting you.

Karin,  I talked to Mike Roberts (the head of the whole weather team), and he is  saying that all expenses for Tony should be charged to Global Products Team.  This is agreed between Vince and Jeff Shankman. Mike and Vince are negotiating with John to put Stephen (or somebody who will  replace him) to some other cost centres (via research).  It looks like Kevin Moore is happy if Stephen is charged to the same cost  centre as Tony. Let us right now charge Tony and Stephen to the cost centre below . Please, could we charge them separately - when John and Vince make their  decision, we should be able to re-charge.  many thanks,  Slava        Enron Capital & Trade Resources   Canada Corp.

Hi Karin...  I hope you had a splendid holiday!  I wanted to thank you for getting Tony  and I set up here last week.  We seem to have established a steady daily  routine and are supporting several different trading groups in London as well  as continuing our daily support of traders in Houston.  Weve gotten far more  requests for information than we expected, so as a result I will be remaining  in London a little longer than originally expected.  As of now - Im not sure  exactly when Ill be going back to Houston - but Vince has let me know that I  will remain here as long as necessary to ensure adequate daily weather  support for the London traders.    To that end - I think I will need one additional piece of software installed  on the machine that I will be using on a regular basis.  Could I please get  Microsoft FrontPage installed as soon as we can get it?    That leads to the second issue of desks.  I know that space is a premium here  - and I understand that I may need to move around some as a result.  I  certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but I also  wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that  are essential for the daily trader support in London and Houston.  As such,  if I move, we will need to make sure that these applications are available  from the beginning of the day (we start about 0600).  The applications are:  1)  Adobe Acrobat - Full Version 2) AccuWeather For Windows - (This is something I will need to install) 3) Microsoft Front Page 4) Terminal Server 5) The full MS Office software package  One idea would be to have a PC move with me - that way we would not need to  reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support  routine.  Thanks again for all of your help.  I will let you know - once I know - how  long I will be here.  I should hear something from Vince over the next few  days giving me an idea.

Unfortunately, supply and demand is not a good indicator of predicting prices because of the economic complexity of processing aromatics.  Statistically, there is no relationship between utilization, supply, demand and price.  Inserting time lag does not make the number any better either.   Christian         -----Original Message----- From:  Neale, Nelson   Sent: Thursday, April 12, 2001 5:23 PM To: LeBroc, Christian Subject: Re: Petrochemical Forward Curves  Hi Christian,  Both mean reversion and GBM models assume that all information related to a future price may be found in the historical price.  The approach employed in the ag curves suggests that there may be some fundamental information related to supply and demand that impacts also drives future price.  A portion of the mean reversion process is actually captured with inclusion of lagged prices  (autoregressive component).  A GBM process requires some information on price volatility.  Since there is presumably no forward/future curve for the commodity of interest, it is difficult to come up with historical volatility values.  Hope it helps.

resumes	<18408514.1075840786121.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Re: Interview	Steve,  I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather negative: he seems to be a consultant type person who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth and technical details.  He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive side.  Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after 18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.  He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing objectivity in favour of technical advancement.  He didnt seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he didnt want to be an administrator)  He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).  regards  Steve	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com	enron.com	Stephen Stock <Stephen Stock/ENRON@enronXgate@ENRON> stephen.stock@enron.com	Vince J Kaminski <Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT> vince.kaminski@enron.com	2001-04-20T02:25:00+00:00

Projects	<15645786.1075856587159.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Petrochem Desk	I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to  curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in  April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at  construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or  SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of  the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked  about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that theyd only been  around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John  Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.     From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at  least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to  understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday  during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX  component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could  then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors  (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

We need a Sun server to take over the task. As it happens Martin Lin has one  in his office hes not using and up to the task. His box could serve SAS to  Enron, as well as handle listening in on the EOL feedds and maintaining its  database.  Martins box technically belongs to EBS, but I think they are downsizing and  wouldnt mind giving it up.  In this way, you would have complete physical and administrative custody over  the data and any work you do with it. I neednt be involved, and you can know  your work is completely confidential.  Ill make SAS and the EOL software available, as well as the necessary RAM  the server, at no charge. You just need to summon up some SysAdmin resources  to finish the job. There is a fine Unix guy named Ben Thompson who will  support you, Im sure.  Task:  1) Upgrade RAM on Martins server 2) Install newest Solaris OS on server 3) Install Tibco and GNU software on server 4) Install SAS on server  Clayton	Clayton Vernon clayton.vernon@enron.com	enron.com	Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com		2001-04-23T11:15:00+00:00
Projects	<15266317.1075856587047.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	RE: EOL Pricing Algorithm	Hi Bob,  some comments : 1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after  limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.   I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the  trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and  offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this  target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and  without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron  position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights. 2.

We need a Sun server to take over the task. As it happens Martin Lin has one in his office hes not using and up to the task. His box could serve SAS to Enron, as well as handle listening in on the EOL feedds and maintaining its database.  Martins box technically belongs to EBS, but I think they are downsizing and wouldnt mind giving it up.  In this way, you would have complete physical and administrative custody over the data and any work you do with it. I neednt be involved, and you can know your work is completely confidential.  Ill make SAS and the EOL software available, as well as the necessary RAM the server, at no charge. You just need to summon up some SysAdmin resources to finish the job.

Projects	<31898331.1075840777861.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	RE: EOL Pricing Algorithm	Hi Bob,  some comments : 1.  You request Enron position after successful market order, but not after limit order  -- you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent.  I am not clear on how you would use Enron position.  It is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position, but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere, and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual Enron position to.  Of course, Enron position may still provide some insights. 2.  You request bid-mid-ask prices for each trade --- given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order (especially for limit orders), would you need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over this time interval (time of order to time of execution)?  Also, for failed trades, you may need the evolution or range of bid-mid-ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection.

Rich sent to many  people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide  some feedback.  I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We  can call it Dynamic bid-ask price process. In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is  submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final  (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last tentative price shown to  the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the  final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)  I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via  EnronOnline.com. -Chonawee   ---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on  04/24/2001 07:48 PM ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat 04/24/2001 07:40 PM To: Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Harkness/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, James  Ginty/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jim Fallon/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Kelly Kimberly/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Kevin Howard/Enron Communications@Enron  Communications, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications,  Kristin Albrecht/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kristina  Mordaunt/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin  Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Paul Racicot/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Zachary McCarroll/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications   Subject: calculating bid-ask prices   I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to  forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market,  we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some  positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the  studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the  price easily.  One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange  system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading  period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post  tentative bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their  acceptable buying or selling price. These tentative bid-ask prices get  updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw  their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we  calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower  selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer  who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask  price. Next week, we repeat the same process.  This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a  broker where we dont take any position at all. We make profit from those  bid-ask spread. We dont have to worry about forecasting accuracy and  insiders trading because we dont have to take any position. Let the market  be the one who decides the price.   If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual  gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers  with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the  mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

I think that we, as a market maker, can  reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the mark-to-market  charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the  gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way  as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the  couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money. In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined  from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price  should go up.) We can offer other derivative products such as options as well. -Chonawee	Chonawee Supatgiat chonawee.supatgiat@enron.com	enron.com	Stinson Gibner stinson.gibner@enron.com  Vince J Kaminski vince.kaminski@enron.com		2001-04-24T20:02:00+00:00

Projects	<1115920.1075840777837.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	calculating bid-ask prices	This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movies gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback.  I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We can call it Dynamic bid-ask price process. In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last tentative price shown to the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)  I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via EnronOnline.com. -Chonawee   ---------------------- Forwarded by Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron on 04/24/2001 07:48 PM ---------------------------   Chonawee Supatgiat 04/24/2001 07:40 PM To: Richard DiMichele/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Harkness/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, James Ginty/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jim Fallon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kelly Kimberly/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kevin Howard/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Key Kasravi/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kristin Albrecht/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kristina Mordaunt/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Paul Racicot/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Zachary McCarroll/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Martin Lin/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications   Subject: calculating bid-ask prices   I think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to forecast it. Otherwise, if our forecast is not consistence with the market, we may have an imbalance in the bid-ask orders and we may end up taking some positions. You know, as Russ and Martin pointed out, we cannot fight with the studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the price easily.  One way to ensure the balance of the bid-ask orders is to embed an exchange system inside our bid-ask prices front end. Each week, we have a trading period. During the period, instead of posting bid-ask prices, we post tentative bid-ask prices, then we ask our customers to submit their acceptable buying or selling price. These tentative bid-ask prices get updated and are shown to the public. Of course, customers can revise/withdraw their bids anytime during the trading period. At the end of the period, we calculate and post the final bid and ask prices. The seller who submits lower selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price. The buyer who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask price. Next week, we repeat the same process.  This way, we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a broker where we dont take any position at all. We make profit from those bid-ask spread. We dont have to worry about forecasting accuracy and insiders trading because we dont have to take any position. Let the market be the one who decides the price.   If we maintain our net position as zero, at the end, when all the actual gross box office numbers are reported in those publications, our customers with open long/short positions are perfectly matched. Using the mark-to-market charge can reduce credit risk.

I think that we, as a market maker, can reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the mark-to-market charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money. In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price should go up.) We can offer other derivative products such as options as well. -Chonawee	Chonawee Supatgiat <Chonawee Supatgiat/Corp/Enron@ENRON> chonawee.supatgiat@enron.com	enron.com	Stinson Gibner <Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT> stinson.gibner@enron.com  Vince J Kaminski <Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT> vince.kaminski@enron.com		2001-04-25T06:02:00+00:00

However, I appreciate you volunteering to potentially having been on such a round table discussion.  Ive been teaching a real options course that has the students performing monte carlo analysis, Black-Scholes pricing, and binomial pricing along with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing.  A few of your new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course. However, I have a student who will be finishing his MBA next spring that is particularly good.  He is genuinely interested and curious about option pricing, trading, and hedging with Excel/VBA skills.  In fact, he usually figures out when I make even very small mistakes in my calculations.  This is not to say that some of my other students arent very talented themselves, but that this person really stands out.  Do you think you and/or Enron would be interested in such a person?  If so, what do you recommend that he do to get his foot in the door?  His intention is to finish the MBA, but I do not know if this would preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now.  His name is George Moss and I ordinarily would not bother you directly about a potential employee.  I am making an exception in this case because he is a particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant.  Otherwise, I hope this e-mail finds you doing well and not travelling too much.  Tom Professor Tom Arnold E.J.

Just simple  instruments like Credit Swaps will require serious modelling capability for the  pricing and the hedging of these apparently simple intruments. The market  visibility I mention above can be explored through Credit Derivatives Trading  successfully if Enron possesses superior (vis a vis Morgan Stanley, Salomon  Smith Barney, Chase Manhatan, etc.) modelling technology in Credit  Derivatives. I can and would like to consider the possibility of doing this  for Enron. I would like to help develop and participate in putting together that  business.           As I  mentioned to you I have done some work in Credit Derivatives and am deeply  familiar with virtually all the work of the principal academics in Credit  Derivatives namely: Duffie, Lando, Tuffano, Duffee, Das, Lelland, etc. I have  read carefully most of their work (published as well as working papers) on the  subject to date.           I look  forward to hearing from you.

resumes	<13677457.1075840785825.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Interview - Numerical Methods & Finance	Dear  Tanya:                It was a  great pleasure to have met you. I very much enjoyed the interview and your  insightfull questions.           I am keenly  aware that many of the methods that I discussed with you yesterday are unique,  new and not reported elsewhere. This is true both about the work I did in  whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as GARCH. The innovations  stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that I have both in  turbulence physics as well as finance. They entailed considering the problem  from its raw formulation, mathematical analysis, physical interpretation,  taylored numerical method development, software writting and develoment and data  management.           As to why I  have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has  been adding value to the business not publishing. Publishing is however an  option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the  work that I did.           I not however  that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the  mathematics, finance, software design and data managemnet aspects of the  problem. Absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and  execution.           Please recall  that as good as they were the performance measures that I mentioned to you were  for a single processor machine. Vastly better can be achieved with both soft  parallelism (multithreading) as well as hard parallelism (heterogenous network).  This fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used.           In fact I  know for a fact that better can be done than what I mentioned in the interview.  From work that I have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility  surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model ITM and OTM instruments can  be included in both the callibration, pricing and hedging.            I look  forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us  cooperating.

Techmemos	<20625198.1075856594200.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update 4/27/01	The following report contains confidential and sensitive information.  Please  treat with discretion.  Executive Summary: ? FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives.  Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from  an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new  power generation ? Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of  out-of-state generators ? June 1st kill clause for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional  plan ? California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected  $20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper  Administration involvement ? QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling ? Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout  deal  1. FERC Fallout The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks  like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to  continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the  Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the  Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation.  It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan.   2. Something Less than Effective Price Caps  From Daviss point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws: ? The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west.  Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  California. ? As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling. ? State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion. ? Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the  cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.  3. Proposal Kill Clause Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis The FERC proposal includes a kill clause that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless Californias ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the  regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesnt sign on to the  regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines  blaming him for letting the Bush price caps plan collapse.  4. Growing Fiscal Risk in California Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion  on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of  PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the  situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for  power.  The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about  90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.   The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to California.  The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture.  The countrys largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months.  5. QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGEs  accounts,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for  gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs request will be granted. If the   QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw   of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.   6 Delays Likely in New QF Generation The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being  continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.  7. Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a   utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number  of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a  non-bypassable charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is  no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be  used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According  to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private  company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for  the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not   stand a likely constitutional challenge.    8. Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts The issue of the Governors failure to  disclose the details of the long-term  power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.   Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged, creating an even further delay.

He just didnt believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried Wolf! so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims.   But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state =01* and nobody will believe it.   True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators.   But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isnt workable competition in Californias power market, and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently =01* and very profitably =01* short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity.   As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the states power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You cant tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market =01* a view shared by a growing number of other researchers.   Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey =01* the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls =01* voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual.   Whats wrong with FERCs plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions =01* ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering =01* selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient.   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there =01* indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts =01* but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesnt get it, that it just cant bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last weeks action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster.   Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/opinion/29KRUG.html?ex=3D989601563&ei=3D1= &en=3D6a9 00f004b3b1abf  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

Whats wrong with FERCs plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not.   Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering - selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient.   The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there - indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them.   The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesnt get it, that it just cant bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last weeks action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster.   Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/29/opinion/29KRUG.html?ex=989601563&ei=1&en=6a900f004b3b1abf  /-----------------------------------------------------------------\   Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web, updated throughout the day.

Projects	<8518283.1075856587002.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Non-firm power curve building	Hi Vince,   Amitava and I have received a request to build a non-firm power curve for  each region from David Hoogs Double Trigger folks.  The objective, as they  explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy Davids  outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve  to mark the non-firm position.  My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but  it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they  have put the ball in David Hoogs court to build the curve if David wants to  sell his product internally to the desk.    Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define non-firm?   The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific  generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of Davids  outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of  non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible --- what does it mean to  give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem  anywhere in the region?  Consequently, the non-firm curve takes on a  unit-level interpretation, and not a region-level interpretation.   Consequently, I do not see how we can talk about the non-firm curve for the  region?  We will need to build a non-firm curve for each generation unit or  group of units.  Maybe I could get your thoughts later today.

resumes	<21913516.1075840785587.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	Working Paper List & etc	Dear Vince:       I have put together a list of  finance working papers (some of which I brought to the interview last wednesday)  which I have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also (at least  initially) as a learning tool. Several of them, however, do contain  innovations.          I have asked Ms. De Claris to  forward a copy to you.       As I expressed to you earlier I  am particularly interested in Enron Credit Swaps trading platform and the  business opportunities that it will spawn.       I also think that there are  tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the  US. I do not know if Enron has considered or is active in this market. This  would be an area that I am also very interested and in which I think much better  can be done than most of the players in the street.       The question in my mind  (hopefully not prematurely) is: If there is interest here would Enron  consider letting me put together this business?       I look forward to hearing from  you soon.

Techmemos	<10064647.1075856594036.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update 5/4/01	If you have any questions, please contact Kristin Walsh at (713) 853-9510.  Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would double dip into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would eat the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowens language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor = has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is = that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f= urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it = is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas= ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif= ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi= dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl= ier in the crisis.  SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T= he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the = governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au= gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t= o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s= igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi= s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat= es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank= ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.   The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is= suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s= tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th= en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st= ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p= assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Techmemos	<11518152.1075856594008.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update - Urgent Please Read 5/7/01	Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today  The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California  Assembly.  The Republicans are currently in caucus until 3:30 PST and then  will go to the floor for a vote.  The current situation is very fluid, but  sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote,  lacking the two-thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance.  If this is the  case, the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be  forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute  financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely)  Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem would then be the  waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission  line purchase or other assistance.  There is an outside chance that Republican defectors could precipitate from  the current caucus.  There is extreme pressure on the Republicans from Davis  and Angelides.  If the bill failed due to lack of Republican support, it  would provide Davis the opportunity to blame Republicans for on-going  expenditures of $70M/day (power purchases), and a possible bankruptcy by  Socal.  The last Republican who gave support to a democratic bill (AB 1X),  Representative Bill Campbell, lost his job.  Sources also confirm that  Democrats have not met with Republicans on the bond issuance since last week.

Techmemos	<26590004.1075840778086.JavaMail.evans@thyme>	California Update 5/22/01	PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL  A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation  1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt  Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that he was surprised they hadnt already.  He noted that the only reason they havent yet is that they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent and that their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.  He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the Plan Bs are speculative at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.  2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough  Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didnt issue more is that Angelides felt that $12B was all the market could handle.  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptrollers Kathleen Connells office.  3. New Generator Construction  Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be 5-10% short on power all summer.
